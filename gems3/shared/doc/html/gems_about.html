program package for interactive thermodynamic modeling of heterogeneous
aquatic (geo)chemical systems, especially those involving metastability
and dispersity of mineral phases, solid solution - aqueous solution
equilbria, and adsorption/ion exchange. Includes a built-in (default)
thermodynamic database in both thermochemical and reaction formats.</small></font></small><big><small><font size="+1"><small> Processes of irreversible chemical mass transfer can

<p>GEM-Selektor version 3 code is written in C/C++,&nbsp;
using
the Qt4.x UI framework (http://qt.nokia.com)
which
makes GEMS a cross-platform software for Linux, Mac OS X and
Windows
systems. The GEMIPM2K code (the numerical kernel of GEMS3) is a C++
program without any GUI, only with ASCII file I/O, but capable to be
compuled and executed also on
parallel architectures. <br>
