HOW TO PRODUCE AN INSTALLATION PACKAGE OF Qt5-based GEMS3 FOR Mac OSX
10.6 - 10.9

(replaces Produce-mac.txt)

This deployment process is based on the "macdeployqt" utility, located
in ~/Qt/5.3/clang_64/bin/ folder.

1. Make sure that the Qt5 SDK is installed as ~/Qt or in similar folder.
We assume that the Qt library is located in ~/Qt/5.3/clang_64/bin/
and Qt Tools (QtCreator etc.) are located in ~/Qt/.

2. If not yet done, find ~/DevGEMS/trunk/gems-gui/Docs/mac-build-release
directory and copy it recursively into ~/Applications, then rename it to
~/Applications/trunk. Dive into the ~/Applications/trunk/gems3.app/Contents
and refresh recursively the /Resources subfolder contents by copying it
from ~/DevGEMS/trunk/gems-gui/Resources.

3. In the ~/Applications/trunk folder, find the "runmacdeployqt.bat" file
and edit it to make sure that it contains the correct full path to the
"macdeployqt" utility, e.g. Users/<you>/Qt/5.3/clang_64/bin/macdeployqt.
From the latter folder, copy the actual files "qcollectiongenerator",
"qhelpconverter" and "qhelpgenerator" (needed to refresh the help database)
to ~/Applications/trunk/gems3.app/Contents/MacOS.

4. Using QtCreator, build the actual release variant of gems3 executable.
Typically, you should have something like "~/DevGEMS/trunk/gems-gui";
"~/DevGEMS/trunk/standalone"; and "~/DevGEMS/trunk/build-release"
folders at the same level. Find gems3 in /gems3.app in the latter folder
and copy it into ~/Applications/trunk/gems3.app/Contents/MacOS.

5. Open terminal, cd to ~/Applications/trunk and run the command:

        $ runmacdeployqt.sh

This will find and copy all dependence files (Qt libraries, plugins, etc.)
into ~/Applications/trunk/gems3.app, and also will create the gems3.dmg
image file of the GEM-Selektor installer.

6. To make sure that the GEM-Selektor runs correctly: in terminal, cd to ~
(your user home directory) and start the program with the command:

$ exec /Users/<you>/Applications/trunk/gems3.app/Contents/MacOS/gems3 -d

Upon the first start, the gems3 program will create a
~/Library/Gems3/projects folder, in which the test projects are located
(automatically copying from the .../gems3.app/Contents/Resources/projects).
 
7. To complete creating a new GEM-Selektor installer file for Mac OSX:
cd to ~/Applications/trunk/ folder and delete the gems3.dmg file. Then,
to create the installer, run again the command
    $ runmacdeployqt.sh

This will create the file ~/Applications/trunk/gems3.dmg.
Rename it according to the following pattern:

Gems3.2-<rev1>.<rev2>-OSX-x86-64.dmg

where put the same actual revision numbers for GEMS GUI (rev1) and 
GEMS3K (rev2) parts, as used in the built code. The dmg file can now
be distributed.

8. For installation steps, see INSTALL-macosx.txt. Install and test
if it works.
