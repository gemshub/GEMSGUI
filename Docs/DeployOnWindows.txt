HOW TO PRODUCE AN INSTALLATION PACKAGE OF Qt5-based GEMS3 FOR Win32 MinGW 4.8 
(Windows XP, 7 or 8; admininstrator rights for your account are needed)

(replaces Produce-windows.txt)

This deployment process is based on the "windeployqt.exe" utility,
which is an augmented "windeployqt.exe" binary by lkc, taken from
https://github.com/lkc/windeployqt.

1. Make sure that the Qt5 SDK is installed as C:\Qt or in similar folder.
We assume that the Qt library is located in C:\Qt5\5.3\mingw482_32\bin
and Qt Tools are located in C:\Qt5\Tools\mingw482_32\bin (or similar, 
depending on the current Qt version, MinGW version and their locations).  

2. If not yet done, go into the .\Docs\win-build-release directory and 
copy recursively the folder \GEMS3DEPLOY to C:\ drive. Dive into the 
C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Gems3-app folder. Refresh recursively the \Resources
subfolder (from .gems-gui\Resources in GEM-Selektor source code tree). 

3. In the C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Gems3-app folder, edit the "runwindeployqt.bat" 
file to make sure that it contains the correct paths to 
C:\Qt5\5.3\mingw482_32\bin and C:\Qt5\Tools\mingw482_32\bin directories
(modify to actual ones, if necessary). Copy (or refresh) the files 
qcollectiongenerator.exe, qhelpconverter.exe and qhelpgenerator.exe 
from C:\Qt5\5.3\mingw482_32\bin to C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Gems3-app folder.   

4. Using QtCreator, build the actual release variant of gems3.exe. 
Typically, you should have something like "C:\DevGEMS\trunk\gems-gui";
"C:\DevGEMS\trunk\standalone"; and "C:\DevGEMS\trunk\build-release" 
folders at the same level. Find gems3.exe in the latter folder and copy
it into the C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Gems3-app folder.  

5. In command-line prompt window (terminal), cd to C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Gems3-app 
and run the command:

	>runwindeployqt.bat gems3.exe

This will find and copy all dependence files (Qt libraries, plugins, runtime 
MinGW libraries, locale files, etc.) into C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Gems3-app folder. 

6. To test that GEM-Selektor runs correctly: cd to C:\GEMS3DEPLOY and 
check that the bach file "rungems3.bat" contains correct path to the folder
where the gems3.exe file is located (e.g. C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Gems3-app). Edit, 
if necessary (see also Readme3.txt). Then start GEM-Selektor by executing
the rungems3.bat file. Upon the first start, the program will create a 
C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Library\Gems3\projects folder, in which the test projects\
are located (by copying them from C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Gems3-app\Resources\projects).  
 
7. To create a new GEM-Selektor installer file for Windows 7 or Windows 8:

If not yet done, download and install 7-zip v.9.20 (http://www.7-zip.org/). 
Start it and select the C:\GEMS3DEPLOY folder. Add it contents (i.e. 
Gems3-app folder and a few files) recursively to the 
archive (to be created e.g. in C:\TEMP folder) "C:\TEMP\GEMS3DEPLOY.7z". 

If not yet done, download and install 7zip-sfx-maker v.3.3 utility from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/sfx-maker/ . Also download ResourceHacker 
v.3.6 from http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/; install it into 
"C:\Program Files (x86)\7-Zip SFX Maker\Resource Hacker" folder. 

Start the 7zip-sfx-maker as an administrator and click on "Load Settings..." 
button. Select the file 
.\Docs\win-build-release\Self-extractor-GEMS3-settings.xml 
(the path is shown relative to the folder in which this file 
DeployOnWindows.txt is located). 
Then, using "+" button or "Files" "Add 7z file...", select the 
file "C:\TEMP\GEMS3DEPLOY.7z" prepared previously. Click through tabs 
"Dialogs", "Tasks", "Metadata" and edit what is necessary, e.g. revision
and version numbers, date of production, etc. When done, click on "Save 
settings..." button to save settings to the file
 .\Docs\win-build-release\Self-extractor-GEMS3-settings.xml
which is under version control. Then click on the "Make SFX" button to 
create the self-installer file. This will create a file 
C:\TEMP\GEMS3DEPLOY.sfx.exe. Rename it according to the following pattern:

	C:\TEMP\gems3.2-<rev1>.<rev2>-win32-install.sfx.exe 

where put the same actual revision numbers for GEMS GUI (rev1) and 
GEMS3K (rev2) parts, as used in "Self-extractor-GEMS3-settings.xml" 
file. The self-extracting installer can now be distributed. 

8. For installation steps, see INSTALL-windows.txt. Install and test 
if it works.
