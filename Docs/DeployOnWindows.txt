HOW TO PRODUCE AN INSTALLATION PACKAGE OF Qt5-based GEMS3 FOR Win32 MinGW 7.3 
or up (Windows 10; admininstrator rights for your account are needed)

(replaces Produce-windows.txt)

This deployment process is based on the "windeployqt.exe" utility provided by
the Qt5 installation on Windows.

1. Make sure that the Qt5 SDK is installed as C:\Qt or in similar folder.
We assume that the Qt library is located in C:\Qt\5.12.7\mingw73_64\bin
and MinGW compiler is located in C:\Qt\Tools\mingw730_64\bin (or similar, 
depending on the current Qt version, MinGW version and their locations).  

2. If not yet done, go into the .\Docs\win-build-release directory and 
copy recursively the folder \GEMS3DEPLOY to C:\ drive. Dive into the 
C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Gems3-app folder. Refresh recursively the \Resources
subfolder (from .gems-gui\Resources in GEM-Selektor source code tree). 

3. In the C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Gems3-app folder, edit the "runwindeployqt.bat" 
file to make sure that it contains the correct paths  
C:\Qt\5.12.7\mingw73_64\bin and C:\Qt\Tools\mingw730_64\bin directories
(modify to actual ones, if necessary). Copy/refresh files windeployqt.exe, 
qcollectiongenerator.exe and qhelpgenerator.exe 
from C:\Qt\5.12.7\mingw73_64\bin to the C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Gems3-app folder.   

4. Using QtCreator, build the actual release variant of gems3.exe. 
Typically, you should have something like "C:\DevGEMS\trunk\gems-gui";
"C:\DevGEMS\trunk\standalone"; and "C:\DevGEMS\trunk\build-release" 
folders at the same level. Find gems3.exe in the latter folder and copy
it into the C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Gems3-app folder.  

5. Go into C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Gems3-app folder and edit there the file 
runwindeployqt.bat so that the PATH variables there would point to actual 
locations of the Ot and MinGW binaries (see paragraph 1 above). In the 
command-line prompt window (terminal), cd to C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Gems3-app 
and run the following command:

    >runwindeployqt.bat gems3.exe

This will find and copy all dependence files (Qt libraries, plugins, runtime 
MinGW libraries, locale files, etc.) into C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Gems3-app folder.
After that, you can delete the file windeployqt.exe to save space in the 
installer self-extracting archive. More about deployment of Qt applications 
on Windows can be found in Qt5 documentation, see 
http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows-deployment.html

6. To test whether GEM-Selektor runs correctly: cd to C:\GEMS3DEPLOY and 
check that the batch file "rungems3.bat" contains correct path to the folder
where the gems3.exe file is located (e.g. C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Gems3-app). Edit, 
if necessary (see also Readme3.txt). Then start GEM-Selektor by executing
the rungems3.bat file. Upon the first start, the program will create a 
C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Library\Gems3\projects folder, in which test projects are
located (by copying them from C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Gems3-app\Resources\projects).
After quitting gems3.exe, delete recursively folder C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Library 
in order to avoid that it is packed into the installer sfx file (see below).   
 
7. To create a new GEM-Selektor installer file for Windows 10:

If not yet done, download and install 7-zip (http://www.7-zip.org/). 
Start it and select the C:\GEMS3DEPLOY folder. Add it contents (i.e. 
Gems3-app folder and a few files) recursively to the archive 
and then move it to the C:\TEMP folder "C:\TEMP\GEMS3DEPLOY.7z". 
Attention: when adding files to archive, choose LZMA but not LZMA2 
compression method!

If not yet done, download and install 7zip-sfx-maker utility program 
from http://sourceforge.net/projects/sfx-maker/ . Also download ResourceHacker 
v.3.6 from http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/; install it into 
"C:\Program Files (x86)\7-Zip SFX Maker\Resource Hacker" folder. Copy the
ResourceHacker.exe file from that folder to 
"C:\Program Files (x86)\7-Zip SFX Maker\Resources\" and rename there into 
ResHacker.exe. It may also be necessary to download the UPX utility from 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/upx/files/ and unzip it into the same folder
where ResHacker.exe resides. Also copy the file gems3.ico from
C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Gems3-app\Resources\ to folder (\7-Zip SFX Maker\Resources\).    

Start the 7zip-sfx-maker as an administrator and click on "Load Settings..." 
button. Select .\Docs\win-build-release\Self-extractor-GEMS3-settings.xml 
(the path is shown relative to the folder in which the current document
DeployOnWindows.txt is located). The xml file should be edited in beforehand
to indicate the actual revisions, version, date of release, etc.  

Then, using "+" button or "Files" "Add 7z file...", select the 
file "C:\TEMP\GEMS3DEPLOY.7z" prepared previously. Click through tabs 
"Dialogs", "Tasks", "Metadata" and edit what is necessary, e.g. revision
and version numbers, date of production, etc. When done, click on "Save 
settings..." button to save settings to the file
 .\Docs\win-build-release\Self-extractor-GEMS3-settings.xml
which is under version control. Then click on the "Make SFX" button to 
create the self-installer file. This will create a file 
C:\TEMP\GEMS3DEPLOY.sfx.exe. Rename it according to the following pattern:

	C:\TEMP\gems3.7.x-<rev1>.<rev2>-win32-install.sfx.exe 

where put the same actual revision numbers for GEMS GUI (rev1) and GEMS3K 
(rev2) parts, as those used in the "Self-extractor-GEMS3-settings.xml" 
file. The self-extracting installer can now be distributed. 

8. For installation steps, see INSTALL-windows.txt. Install and test 
if everything works.
