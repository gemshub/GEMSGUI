To install GEMS3.1 on Mac OS X 10.7 and up:

1. Click on the installer dmg file to mount it. A window appears with the application gems3.app. 

2. Drag gems3.app from that window to the /Applications folder. The gems3.app contains program 
   and resource files, including help database and /DB.default folder with the thermodynamic database.   

3. Start GEM-Selektor once by opening the terminal, cd to your home folder, and run a command:

    $ exec /Applications/gems3.app/Contents/MacOS/gems3 -d

This will create a subfolder ~/Library/Gems3/projects if not yet available in your home directory,
where some test modeling projects will be copied, and your own modeling projects will be stored
later on. This command will also reset configuration files to point to your actual locations.

4. You can add your old projects folders into ~/Library/gems3/projects/. Backup of modeling
   projects is strongly recommended at least once per day. 

5. To normally start GEM-Selektor, go to /Applications folder and double-click on "gems3.app".
To add the GEMS3.2 icon to Dock, right-click on GEMS3 icon in the Dock, and select "Keep in Dock".

6. To update GEM-Selektor: just move gems3.app from /Applications to Trash, and proceed with step
1 through 3. Only files in gems3.app will be replaced; your own modeling projects, located in
~/Library/gems3/projects/ folder, will not be affected. To locate this folder in Finder, click
on Mac OSX desktop, "Go" "Go to folder...", type "~/Library" in the appearing dialog, and click
the "Go" button.
