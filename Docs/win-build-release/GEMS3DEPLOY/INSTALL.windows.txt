To install GEM-Selektor v3.x on Windows XP, Windows 7, or Windows 8: 

1. Copy the installer file into a temporary location and execute it.  

2. The installer will ask where to install/update, showing C:\GEMS3DEPLOY as a suggestion. 
   If you accept this, the program will be located in C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Gems3-app. This folder 
   contains the program and the resource files, including help database and /DB.default 
   folder with the thermodynamic database.  
   Upon the first start, a folder C:\GEMS3DEPLOY\Library\Gems3\projects will be created, 
   where modeling projects will be stored. 

3. Alternatively, you can type or select another location (\Program Files is not recommended), 
   for example D:\MyWork\Modeling. In this case, the program will be located in 
   D:\MyWork\Modeling\Gems3-app and the projects- in D:\MyWork\Modeling\Library\Gems3\projects.

3. After extracting files, GEMS will start; you can exit it and look for a GEMS v3.2 icon on 
   your desktop, to be used further on for staring GEMS.  

5. You can add your old projects folders into \Library\gems3\projects\. Backup of modeling 
   projects is strongly recommended at least once per day. 


To update GEMS3, start the self-extracting installer and browse to the location where GEMS 
is installed, for example, to D:\MyWork\Modeling. Only files in the /Gems3-app subfolder 
will be updated; your modeling projects in /Library/gems3/projects/ will not be changed. 
Alternatively (to make sure that no trash files remain after the update), you can delete 
the /Gems3-app subfolder before running the GEMS3 installer self-extractor file.
