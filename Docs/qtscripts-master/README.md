Qt Related Linux Scripts

These are a random collection of bash and shell scripts I use for things Qt related.  They probably won't work "out of the box" for you, but feel free to modify them to suit your needs if you think they may help.

Additional information on "deployqtapp.sh" and "fixdep.sh" can be found in this post:
