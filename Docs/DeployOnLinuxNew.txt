HOW TO PRODUCE AN INSTALLATION PACKAGE OF Qt5/6-based GEMS3 FOR LINUX

(replaces DeployOnLinux.txt). Works on ubuntu 18.04 bionic or older.

This is based on linuxdeployqt tool (https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt),
which is an augmented macdeployqt tool distributed with Qt framework.
Download this tool from https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt/releases
, file linuxdeployqt-continuous-x86_64.AppImage, and chmod a+x it to make it executable.

1. Make sure that Qt framework is installed with source code as /Qt in your
home directory; we assume that the Qt library is located at ~/Qt/5.15.2/gcc_64.
If not yet done, copy recursively the "/Docs/build-release-new" directory from 
the folder where this file is located to your home directory. 

2. Copy/refresh the folder Resources from "~/gitGEMS/gems3gui/Resources" to 
"~/build-release-new/AppDir/usr/bin/Resources". Fix the version by editing the 
"/share/applications/GEM-Selektor.desktop" file.

3. Make sure that you have built and tested a release variant of the GEM-Selektor 
v.3.9.6 code (using QtCreator started from ~/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/bin) in the 
"~/git/GEMS3/build-release" folder. When done, copy the "gems3" executable to
"~/build-release-new/AppDir/usr/bin/gems3". Also copy the "qhelpgenerator" executable from "~/Qt/5.15.2/gcc_64/bin/" folder to "~/build-release-new/AppDir/usr/bin/". 
Set the version by a command:

export Version=3.9.6
export VERSION=3.9.6

4. The -appimage option of linuxdeployqt assumes that the application folder is under git control. 
If not yet done so, cd to "~/build-release-new", and execute:

git init
git add .
git commit -m 'Initial commit in GEMS build release new repository'

5. cd to "~/build-release-new", and execute the linuxdeployqt utility:

./linuxdeployqt-continuous-x86_64.AppImage /home/<your_user>/build-release-new/AppDir/usr/share/applications/*.desktop -appimage -verbose=2 -qmake=$HOME/Qt/5.15.2/gcc_64/bin/qmake -no-translations -bundle-non-qt-libs

In this process, there may be errors regarding the absence of some libraries in 
ubuntu linux. Upon testing on Kubuntu 18.04 LTS, to get rid of such errors, two 
packages had to be installed additionally:

sudo apt-get install unixodbc-dev libpq-dev 

6. When finished, find the AppRun file and execute it once to start GEM-Selektor:

./AppRun -d

Close GEM-Selektor and repeat the AppImage generation command given in Section 5.
Then git commit all changes and copy the generated file "GEM-Selektor-3.9.6-x86_64.AppImage"
to the ~/GEMS396 folder (create it if needed). In that folder, rename the AppImage file into
"GEM-Selektor-3.9.6-linux-x86_64.AppImage". Execute this file to run GEM-Selektor and pin the 
GEM-Selektor entry to taskbar or desktop to start it easily next time. 

Copy the file "GEM-Selektor-3.9.6-linux-x86_64.AppImage" to a location for subsequent distribution.

Appendix: Usage of linuxdeployqt (https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt) see README.md

Usage: linuxdeployqt <app-binary|desktop file> [options]

Options:
   -always-overwrite        : Copy files even if the target file exists.
   -appimage                : Create an AppImage (implies -bundle-non-qt-libs).
   -bundle-non-qt-libs      : Also bundle non-core, non-Qt libraries.
   -exclude-libs=<list>     : List of libraries which should be excluded,
                              separated by comma.
   -ignore-glob=<glob>      : Glob pattern relative to appdir to ignore when
                              searching for libraries.
   -executable=<path>       : Let the given executable use the deployed libraries
                              too
   -extra-plugins=<list>    : List of extra plugins which should be deployed,
                              separated by comma.
   -no-copy-copyright-files : Skip deployment of copyright files.
   -no-plugins              : Skip plugin deployment.
   -no-strip                : Don't run 'strip' on the binaries.
   -no-translations         : Skip deployment of translations.
   -qmake=<path>            : The qmake executable to use.
   -qmldir=<path>           : Scan for QML imports in the given path.
   -qmlimport=<path>        : Add the given path to QML module search locations.
   -show-exclude-libs       : Print exclude libraries list.
   -verbose=<0-3>           : 0 = no output, 1 = error/warning (default),
                              2 = normal, 3 = debug.
   -updateinformation=<update string>        : Embed update information STRING; if zsyncmake is installed, generate zsync file
   -version                 : Print version statement and exit.

linuxdeployqt takes an application as input and makes it
self-contained by copying in the Qt libraries and plugins that
the application uses.

By default it deploys the Qt instance that qmake on the $PATH points to.
The '-qmake' option can be used to point to the qmake executable
to be used instead.

Plugins related to a Qt library are copied in with the library.

See the "Deploying Applications on Linux" topic in the
documentation for more information about deployment on Linux.
