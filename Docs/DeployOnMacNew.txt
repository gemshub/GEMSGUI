HOW TO PRODUCE AN INSTALLATION PACKAGE OF Qt5-based GEMS3 FOR MacOSX
10.10 - 15.1

(replaces Produce-mac.txt)

This deployment process is based on the "macdeployqt" utility, located
in ~/Qt/5.15.2/clang_64/bin/ folder.

1. Make sure that the Qt5.15.2 commmunity framework is installed as ~/Qt
or in similar folder. We assume that the Qt library is located in
~/Qt/5.15.2/clang_64/lib/ and Qt Tools (QtCreator.app etc.) are located in
~/Qt/Tools/.

2. If not yet done, find ~/DevGEMS/gems3gui/Docs/mac-build-release
directory and copy it recursively into ~/Applications, then rename it to
~/Applications/trunk. Dive into the ~/Applications/trunk/gems3.app/Contents
and refresh recursively the /Resources subfolder contents by copying it
from ~/DevGEMS/gems3gui/Resources.

3. In the ~/Applications/trunk folder, find the "runmacdeployqt.bat" file
and edit it to make sure that it contains the correct full path to the
"macdeployqt" utility, e.g. /Users/<you>/Qt/5.15.2/clang_64/bin/macdeployqt.
From the latter Qt folder, copy the actual files "qcollectiongenerator"
(only Qt5.x.y) and "qhelpgenerator" (needed to refresh the help database)
to the ~/Applications/trunk/gems3.app/Contents/MacOS folder.

4. Using QtCreator, build the actual release variant of gems3 executable.
You should get something like "~/DevGEMS/gems3gui"; "~/DevGEMS/standalone";
and "~/DevGEMS/devPhase/build-gems3gui-Qt_5_15_2-Release" folders at the same level.
Find gems3 in /gems3.app in the latter folder, and copy it into
~/Applications/trunk/gems3.app/Contents/MacOS.

5. Edit the file ~/Applications/trunk/gems3.app/Contents/info.plist to actual
version and release numbers and year and save this file.

6. Open the terminal, cd to ~/Applications/trunk and run the command:

        $ ./runmacdeployqt.sh

This will find and copy all dependence files (Qt libraries, plugins, etc.)
into ~/Applications/trunk/gems3.app, and also will create the gems3.dmg
image file of the GEM-Selektor installer.

7. To make sure that the GEM-Selektor runs correctly: in terminal, cd to ~
(your user home directory) and start the program with the command:

$ exec /Users/<you>/Applications/trunk/gems3.app/Contents/MacOS/gems3 -d

Upon the first start, the gems3 program will create a
~/Library/Gems3/projects folder, in which the test projects are located
(automatically copying from the .../gems3.app/Contents/Resources/projects).

8. To complete creating a new GEM-Selektor installer file for Mac OSX:
cd to ~/Applications/trunk/ folder and delete the gems3.dmg file. Then,
to create the installer, run again the command
    $ ./runmacdeployqt.sh

This will create the file ~/Applications/trunk/gems3.dmg.
Rename it according to the following pattern:

Gems3.9.2-<rev1>.<rev2>-macos-x86-64.dmg

Put there the same actual git commit numbers for GEMS GUI (rev1) and
GEMS3K (rev2) parts as those used in the built code. For example, the
installer may have the name:

Gems3.9.2-96323c0.8986188-qt5-macos-x86-64.dmg

The dmg file can now be distributed. It should work on Macs with Intel or ARM processors.

9. For installation steps, see INSTALL-macosx.txt. Install and test if it works.
The GEMS modelling projects are located in ~/Library/Gems3/projects.
In Finder, use "Go" "Go to folder" menu and type "Library/Gems3".

10. If the GEM-Selektor window looks not sharp on a high-resolution display,
try in terminal to re-register gems3.app:

~: /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -v -f /Users/<you>/Applications/trunk/gems3.app

Or, if gems3.app is installed in the /Applications folder,

~: /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -v -f /Applications/gems3.app
