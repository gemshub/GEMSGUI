To install GEM-Selektor v.3.3 on linux (ubuntu >= 12.0.4; fedora >= 15; OpenSuSE >=12.0): 

1. Get the installer (e.g. Gems3.3.3-2646.1036-linux-x86-64.tgz file downloaded from GEMS 
web site http://gems.web.psi.ch/GEMS3) into your home directory ~/ ("/home/<you>/").

2. Unpack the installer to your home directory. This will create a folder "~/MyGEMS/Gems3-app/" 
that contains the program and the resource files, including help database and a "/DB.default/" 
folder with the thermodynamic database.

3. Optionally, you can now create in your home directory a folder like "~/MGEMS/" and move 
the folder "~/Gems3-app/" in there.

4. Open the terminal, cd into "/Gems3-app/" wherever it is installed, and execute a command:
  $ ./rungems3.sh -d  

The GEM-Selektor v.3 program should launch; after you exit it, a folder "/Library/Gems3/projects/"
with several test modeling projects will be available at the same level as the "/Gems3-app/" 
folder. If the program does not start, try the following. In terminal, cd to 
"/Gems3-app/platforms" and run there the script "fixdep.sh" with root rights:
   $ sudo ./fixdep.sh

This script can automatically download the necessary libraries for your platform.       

5. You can copy the existing third-party projects, or your old project folders into 
   "/Library/Gems3/projects/". Backup of modeling projects is strongly recommended once a day.

6. To create a desktop shortcut for starting GEMS3: 
   
   copy the file GEMSv3.3.desktop from ".../Gems3-App/ToDesktop/" to the "~/Desktop/" folder; 
   
   right-click on the GEMSv3 icon on your desktop, select "Properties", and edit the actual
   location of the program in command line (e.g. /home/<you>/MyGEMS/Gems3-app/rungems3.sh -c) 
   and location of the GEMS3 icon (e.g. /home/<you>/MyGEMS/Gems3-app/gems3.png), and save.

7. Start GEMS3 by clicking on the desktop icon. If it does not start, check the path in the icon
again, or edit rungems3.sh file by replacing "#!/bin/sh" with b"#!/bin/bash" (depends on the
particular linux distribution). On Ubuntu linux 12.04 or up, you can drag the launcher icon 
from desktop to the launch bar (on the left side) and start GEMS3 by clicking on that icon 
in the launch bar.

8. To update GEMS3, unpack the installer archive and replace with it the existing "/Gems3-app/"
folder only (your projects will remain intact in the "/Library/Gems3/projects" folder).

9. To remove GEMS3 from your PC, simply delete both "/Gems3-app/" and "/Library/Gems3/" folders 
in your home directory.

All operations described above (except running fixdep.ch) do not require root privileges.
