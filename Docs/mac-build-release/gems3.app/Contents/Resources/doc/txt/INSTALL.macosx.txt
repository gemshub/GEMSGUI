To install GEM-Selektor on Mac OS X Snow Leopard, Lion, or Mountain Lion:

1. Click on the installer dmg file to mount it. A window appears with the application Gems3.app.

2. Drag Gems3.app from that window to the "/Applications/" folder. The Gems3.app contains the program and the resource files, including the help database and a "/DB.default/" folder with built-in thermodynamic database.  

3. Start GEMS3 by clicking on Gems3.app in "/Applications/" folder. This will create a subfolder  "~/Library/Gems3/projects/" in your user home directory, where the modeling projects will be stored.

4. You can add third-party or your old project folders into "~/Library/Gems3/projects/". Backup of modeling projects is strongly recommended at least once per day. To see this folder in Finder: open the Terminal; cd to your user's directory; run a command:

      chflags nohidden ~/Library/

This command will have effect until the next reboot or logout/login.

5. To add the GEMS3 icon to Dock: start Gems3.app, right-click on its icon in the dock, and select "Keep in Dock".

6. To update GEMS3: just move Gems3.app from "/Applications/" to Trash, and proceed with step 1. Only files in Gems3.app will be replaced; your modeling projects in "~/Library/Gems3/projects/" will remain unaffected.

7. To remove GEMS3 from your PC:  drag the Gems3.app from "/Applications/" to Trash; cd in ~/Library/ and delete Gems3/ recursively.
