    <h2><a name="PROJECT_INTRO"></a>1. Introduction: Project Structure and
      Record </h2>
    <p>Modelling Project is actually a sub-folder in GEMS "/projects" folder,
      which contains GEMS database files that keep all settings and data
      pertinent to a modeling application. In particular, this sub-folder
      contains a "template" definition of the chemical system and numerical
      settings (Project file); the input thermodynamic and composition data
      records (IComp, DComp, ReacDC, Phase, Compos files); the records defining
      particular systems and their calculation results (SysEq), as well as
      Process simulator (Proces file), Graphic/tabulated data sampler (GtDemo
      file) records, and reactive transport problems (GEM2MT file), references
      and print/export scripts (SDref file).</p>
    <p>Each project has one "project" record in the "project" database file with
      "template" chemical system definition, together with links to a collection
      of GEMS database files where the input data is kept and modelling results
      will be collected. As a rule, these database files are located in the same
      project subfolder. <br>
    </p>
    <p>There are two types of projects: (1) standalone and (2) linked. When a
      standalone project is created, the program copies all necessary data from
      the default database (supplied with the program) into the project database
      files and then disconnects the project from the default database. Such
      projects can be shared between many people or can be presented as test
      examples, regardless of the particular version or update of the default
      GEMS database. When a linked project is created, the program creates
      project database files only for storing the input data extensions and the
      modelling results, but &nbsp;just links the default database files for the
      extraction of input thermodynamic data. Consequently, behavior of the
      models in such a project may change if they will be run within a different
      version of GEMS code and its default thermodynamic database. We recommend
      creating standalone projects whenever possible, even though it requires
      some more work for updating the copied ReacDC records.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The largest part of the Project record consists of several interconnected
      lists of record keys: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="gm_icomp.html">IComp</a> list <a href="#ICvp"><tt>ICvp</tt></a>
        (defines the stoichiometry basis of the system in terms of Independent
        Components)</li>
      <li> <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a>/<a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a>
        list <a href="#DCvp"><tt>DCvp</tt></a> (chemical species available in
        this stoichiometry basis)</li>
      <li> <a href="gm_phase.html">Phase</a> list <a href="#PHvp"><tt>PHvp</tt></a>
        (phases that potentially may appear at equilibrium states)</li>
      <li> <a href="gm_compos.html">Compos</a> list <a href="#CCvp"><tt>CCvp</tt></a>
        (PCO that facilitate setting up the total bulk composition of the
        system).</li>
    </ul>
    <p> In addition, the Project record contains a <a href="#MSfls"><tt>MSfls</tt></a>
      list of 'nicknames' of all database files linked to this project, where
      the program can seek for the records with input data or to store the
      modelling results. All these lists are assembled automatically when the
      user creates a new project, by picking up all records available in all
      currently linked database files. Next time when you switch to "Calculation
      of Equilibria" mode of GEMS and open the project, its Project record will
      be read from the database; the program will link database files according
      to the MSfls configuration list; and then it will read the data from the
      database files and compare it to what has been previously stored in the
      project record lists. This is a quite efficient way to detect what has
      been changed, added or removed from the project database after the last
      modeling session, and to update the project itself and already calculated
      systems accordingly.&nbsp; If you have added/removed some species or
      phases,&nbsp; the program will display warnings (there is a probability
      that you did not really want it!). Just press "Ok" or "Ok to all" buttons
      if you are sure that these changes are correct.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Thermodynamic data array is another important part of the project system
      framework. It is allocated in the program memory after the project has
      been successfully opened; but thermodynamic data arrays are never saved in
      the Project database record. Thermodynamic properties (by default, molar
      Gibbs energy <span style="font-family: Calibri;">gTP</span> and molar
      volume <span style="font-family: Calibri;">vTP</span>) of all species
      referenced in the&nbsp; DComp/ReacDC list <a href="#DCvp"><tt>DCvp</tt></a>
      are automatically calculated every time when you specify different
      temperature and pressure in a <a href="gems_rekey.html#dbm_SysEq">SysEq
        record key</a>. This is done by reading all the DComp or&nbsp; ReacDC
      records in a sequence and applying necessary calculation subroutines
      separately to each record. Thus computed thermodynamic data for T,P of
      interest will be retained without further re-calculation during the whole
      modelling project session, or until different temperature of pressure will
      be specified for a currently loaded SysEq record (usually just by reading
      it from the database). In the Project Wizard, you can allocate some
      additional arrays (e.g. molar absolute entropy <span style="font-family: Calibri;">sTP</span>,
      molar heat capacity <span style="font-family: Calibri;">CpTP</span>,
      molar enthalpy <span style="font-family: Calibri;">hTP</span>), if
      necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Location of the <tt>/projects</tt> folder (where all projects will be
      stored as subfolders) is defined by the &nbsp;<tt>-u</tt> &nbsp;command
      line parameter of gems3 executable file (you can see this location in the
      <a href="gems_setup.html">Preferences Dialog</a>). For instance, <tt>"-u
        D:\GEMS3test"</tt> in the command line tells the program to look for
      existing projects and to store a newly-created project <tt>"MyProject"</tt>
      in <tt>"D:\GEMS3test\projects\MyProject"</tt> folder. This new project is
      as a collection of database files, all containing <tt>"MyProject"</tt> as
      a file name element. If the -u parameter is not given then the program
      will look for projects at the default location, "<span style="font-family: monospace;">/Library/gems3/projects</span>".

      In Windows and Linux variants, this location is at the same level as the
      location where the gems3 executable file resides (i.e. "<span style="font-family: monospace;">/Gems3-app</span>"
      in an upper-level folder under Windows or in user's home directory under
      Linux). In the Mac OS X variant, the default location of executable is "<span
        style="font-family: monospace;">/Applications/Gems3.app/Contents/MacOS</span>"
      and that of user's projects - "<span style="font-family: monospace;">/Users/&lt;user&gt;/Library/gems3</span>".
      <br> </p>
    <p>When creating a new project, the program uses the Default database files,
      located in the <tt>"/Resources/DB.default"</tt> directory. In Windows and
      Linux variants, the folder "<span style="font-family: monospace;">/Resources</span>"
      (which also contains this help database) is installed inside of the "<span
        style="font-family: monospace;">/Gems3-app</span>" folder at the same
      level as the gems3 executable file. In Mac OS X variant of GEMS, the
      folder "<span style="font-family: monospace;">/Resources</span>" is part
      of the Gems3 application, i.e. "<span style="font-family: monospace;">/Applications/Gems3.app/Contents/Resources</span>".
      A different location of the folder in which the executable file and "<span
        style="font-family: monospace;">/Resources</span>" are found (you can
      see this location in the <a href="gems_setup.html">Preferences Dialog</a>)
      can be specified by the &nbsp;<tt>-s</tt> command line parameter. For
      instance, <tt>"-s D:\GEMS3test\Gems3-app"</tt> in the command line tells
      that the default database is located in&nbsp; <tt>"D:\GEMS3test\Gems3-app\Resources\DB.default"</tt>
      folder.<br>
    </p>
    <p>There are two main types of modelling projects (and, accordingly, two
      project setup modes) that can be selected in the<a href="gems_setup.html">
        Preferences Dialog</a>.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a name="PROJECT_LINKED"></a>A "linked" type
      project links selected default database files to the project during its
      whole lifetime. When any equilibria are calculated, the input phase
      definitions and thermodynamic data are collected directly from the default
      database files; only records added by the user (or created by modeling
      calculations) will be stored in the project database files. <br>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a name="PROJECT_INDEPENDENT"></a>A
      "standalone" type project (default in GEM-Selektor v.3) links default
      database files to project only at the stage of its creation or upgrade.
      The default database is searched for all species and phases records
      conforming with the chosen list of Independent Components and other
      selection criteria in the <a href="gems_elements.html">ElementsDialog</a>,
      and such records are immediately copied into the project database files.
      When creation of the project is finished, all default database files are
      disconnected,&nbsp; and the project becomes standalone, i.e. <i>independent</i>
      of the default database. During the project lifetime, the user can change,
      delete or add any phase definition, composition, or thermodynamic data
      records at her/his discretion. Such projects will not be affected by any
      future changes or extensions of the Default database and can be exchanged
      between different users. Another advantage is that the system template in
      an independent project is relatively small and easier to observe because
      it usually involves only a small part of the default database. </p>

    <h3><a name="PROJECT_CREATE"></a>1.2. Creating a New Modelling Project<br>
    </h3>
    <p> To create a <a href="#HOWTO">standalone project</a>, get into the
      "Modelling projects" dialog and click the "New Project" button. This will
      bring you to a small "Enter a new record key" dialog. Type a short project
      name instead of "MyWork" (or click "From List" to pick up one of existing
      Project record keys and modify it); change the comment line (spaces are
      not allowed), and press "Ok".&nbsp; </p>
    <p>This will bring you to Step 1 of a wizard for checking selections of
      source database/subdatabase, Phase/DC filters, and then to a large <a href="gems_elements.html">Elements
        Dialog</a> that looks like the Periodic Table. Select necessary elements
      (and other Independent Components) and press "Ok" when ready. Follow
      warnings and messages that will appear on the screen, as described in more
      detail in the <a href="#HOWTO">GEMS projects HOWTO manual</a>. <br>
    </p>
    <p>To create a new <a href="gm_project.html#HOWTO">"linked" project</a> is
      more complicated because in this case, you cannot use the ElementsDialog

    <p><span style="color: #cc0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attention!
        </span>For introducing the GEM-Selektor v.3.3.x (and respective v.3.3.x
        of the GEMS3K code) in April 2015, the <a href="gm_phase.html">Phase</a>
        record and data definition structure, as well as the Phase remake
        wizard, were substantially extended in order to accommodate more
        flexible mixing models (TSolMod), built-in mineral-water reaction
        kinetics (TKinMet), and a new implementation of sorption and surface
        complexation models (TSorpMod; work in progress).&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: #cc0000;">For backward compatibility, all modelling
        projects created in GEM-Selektor v.3.2.x or earlier, will open and work
        normally in GEM-Selektor v.3.3.x; accordingly, GEMS3K I/O files exported
        from GEM-Selektor v.3.2.x are readable and will work in coupled codes
        and examples using GEMS3K v.3.3.x. A prerequisite of this is that no
        Phase record is created or remade in such a project with the "old"
        record format.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: #cc0000;">Extension of old modeling project in
        GEM-Selektor v.3.3.x with newly created Phase records, remaking existing
        Phase records, or via Project remake/extension wizard is also possible.
        Before doing that, the user needs only once to open the project; switch
        to Database Mode; open the Phase window; and remake </span><span style="color: #cc0000;"><span
          style="color: #cc0000;">one-by-one </span>all Phase records available
        in the project (saving each record back after remake). This will ensure
        that new or modified phases with extended structure and functionality
        will work correctly. </span></p>
    <p><span style="color: #cc0000;">Note that if some Phase records remain in
        the "old" format (i.e. not remade) then this will lead to errors or
        crashes during calculations of equilibria in systems from this project.
        So, it is essential that ALL Phase records go once through the Phase
        remake wizard! Opening and closing the modeling project even once in the
        GEM-Selektor v.3.3.x will render this project unusable in earlier
        versions of GEM-Selektor (3.2.x or less). </span>&nbsp; </p>

    <h2><a name="PROJECT_MWIZARD"></a>2. Project Remake Wizard</h2>
    <p>Modelling project is a collection of GEMS database files for a specific
      range of modeling applications, located in an (automatically created)
      folder having the same name as the project. These files contain records of
      different types (components, phases, compositions, chemical system
      definitions (CSDs), results of equilibrium calculations, process and
      reactive mass transport simulations, etc.); taken together, they comprise
      a project database (<a href="#PROJECT_INTRO">more...</a>). <br>
    </p>
    <p>Main part of the modeling project is a generic definition of chemical
      thermodynamic system, stored in a single Project record (having the same
      name as the project). This record includes lists of record keys for
      Independent Components, Dependent Components, Phases and compositions kept
      in the project database.&nbsp; The Project record also contains links to
      database files where the input data is kept and the modelling results will
      be stored, as well as the numerical controls to be used in GEM
      calculations within this project. These contents are accessible through
      four pages of the Project module window (<a href="#PROJECT_MWINDOW">more...</a>).


      <br> </p>
    <p>The project system image in computer memory also includes arrays of
      thermodynamic data of all kinds to be used in calculations of equilibria
      or in process or reactive transport simulations. These data arrays are
      accessible in "Equilibria Calculation" mode through "Data" "Thermodynamic
      Data" menu command; they are updated automatically when temperature or
      pressure has changed in the SysEq record key, or in the Process or GEM2MT
      module calculation. <br>

    <h3><a name="MWPAGE_2"></a>3.2. Project Window Controls (GEM IPM Numerical
      Controls) Page</h3>
    <p>This window can be important in the case of numerical problems with
      calculation of equilibria (lack of convergence, failure in mass balance,
      divergence of dual solution etc.). If this happens, some adjustments of
      GEM IPM numerical controls may be necessary. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Typically, this page looks like shown below. The title field (Pa_SPP)
      indicates revisions of GEMS and the kernel code under which the set of
      controls has been reset last time. If this is outdated, it makes sense to
      close the project and open it again in the Project Setup Wizard mode (<a href="#HOWTO_REOPEN">more...</a>),


      then select a predefined set of controls <a href="#WZSTEP_1">as described
        here</a>. Typically, this results in good numerical convergence. If this
      did not help, you may need to adjust some controls individually. In the
      Controls page, the respective fields are arranged beginning with the
      controls that are more frequently modified (for instance, Pa_DK, Pa_LLG,
      Pa_DHB). <br>
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>If you modify some controls and save the Projec record then these
      modifications will be available in the next sessions for this project;
      otherwise, the modifications will be lost when the project is closed or
      another project is opened.<br>

    <p>GEM calculations of chemical thermodynamic equilibria can only be
      performed in the context of a currently open modelling project (<a href="#PROJECT_INTRO">more...</a>).
      <br> </p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To access modeling projects</span>,
      switch into "Computation of equilibria" mode by clicking the Equilibrium
      Mode&nbsp;<img style="width: 24px; height: 24px;" alt="EquilibriumModeIcon24.png"
        src="EquilibriumModeIcon24.png">&nbsp; button (or select the "Modules"
      "Change Mode" menu command). This opens a "Modelling Projects" dialog,
      which usually shows a list of accessible existing projects. Each project
      (record) has a key that consists of two fields: Name and Comment. The Name
      is also the name of the project folder; the Comment&nbsp; gives a hint on
      the modeling application contained in the project.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To open an existing modeling
        project</span>, double-click on its key in the list, or click once on it
      and then click on the "Open Project" button. Below the list, there are
      several options, some of which affect how the project will be opened (<a href="#HOWTO_REOPEN">more...</a>).


      After the project is loaded, GEM-Selektor turns into the "Equilibria
      Calculation" mode with "Single Thermodynamic System" dialog visible (<a href="gems_sys.html#HOWTO">more...</a>).</p>
    <p><span style="color: #cc0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attention!

            (Section 1.3)</a> and follow advices there.&nbsp;</span></span>&nbsp;
      </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To create a new modeling
        project</span>, click on a "New Project" button, enter the name and the
      comment into the appearing record key dialog, and click "Ok" (<a href="#HOWTO_CREATE">more...</a>).
In
      the appearing Step 1 page of the wizard, check the selection of
      Phase/component filters and the selection of source database/subdatabase.
      In the appearing next Step 2 page "Elements Dialog", select elements
      (Independent Components) to form the system (<a href="gems_elements.html">more...</a>)
      and click "Ok". In the appearing "Setup of aqueous and gas phases" dialog,
      optionally change settings and click "Ok" (<a href="gems_aphsetup.html">more...</a>).
      This brings GEMS into the Equilibrium Calculations mode; the SysEq record
      key dialog appears for the first system in the new project. Click "Ok" to
      proceed with the default key, or edit the name, pressure, or temperature,
      and then click "Ok". In the appearing "Input Recipe" dialog, type a
      comment to this system definition in the 'tname' field, then make
      selections and enter numbers for the input of bulk composition (<a href="gems_bcc.html#RECIPE">more...</a>),
      and click "Ok". Now check, calculate, and save the first equilibrium state
      in the project (<a href="gems_sys.html#HOWTO">more...</a>). Proceed with
      'cloning' the next SysEq record. <br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To expand (clone) a project
        into a new one</span>: activate the option "Create a new project using
      the selected one..."; select the project in the list; and click the "New
      Project" button. In the appearing record key dialog, enter a new project
      name and a comment, click "Ok"; in the Elements Wizard Step 1, if
      necessary, check selection of source database/subdatabase, then at Step 2
      select additional elements, and proceed as by creating a brand new project
      (<a href="#HOWTO_EXPAND">more...</a>). &nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To share a modeling project</span>
      with other users of GEM-Selektor (or to back-up it): locate the user
      modelling projects directory (use "Help" "Preferences" menu command to
      open Settings and Preferences dialog and see this location path under
      "User's projects folder"). Close GEMS, locate the project and zip it as a
      whole subfolder. Place this zip file in backup folder or send it to
      somebody else. To add a project, unzip it's folder into your projects
      folder, then start GEMS; you should see it in the projects list. We
      recommend to backup the project folder that you currently work with at
      least one- or two times per day. <br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To remove a modeling project</span>:
      exit GEMS; use file manager or terminal to locate your projects subfolder;
      select the project folder there; delete it or move it away
      completely.&nbsp; </p>

    <p> To create a <a href="#PROJECT_INDEPENDENT">standalone project</a>, get
      into the "Modelling projects" dialog and click the "New Project" button.
      This will bring you to a small "Enter a new record key" dialog. Type a
      short project name instead of "MyWork" (or click "From List" to pick up
      one of existing Project record keys and modify it); change the comment
      line (spaces are not allowed), and press "Ok". This will bring you to a
      large <a href="gems_elements.html">Elements Wizard</a> that has two
      steps, one for checking the selection of source built-in database or
      sub-database and/or Phase/component filters, and another showing a dialog

        Elements Dialog and Selections from the Default Database</font></h3>
    <p>In this dialog (Step 2 of the Elements Wizard), you can select elements
      (and other Independent Components) to form the stoichiometry basis of the
      modeling project. By default, the program will look through default
      (selected at Step 1) database/subdatabase files, find all dependent
      components, phases and compositions that are consistent with the chosen
      list of Independent Components, and copy these records into respective
      files of the project database. When finished, the built-in database files
      will be disconnected. The user can then modify and extend the project
      database, but this will have no effect on the default database; if any
      changes occurred in the built-in database after the program package
      upgrade, this will also have no effect on the project database. This kind
      of <a href="#PROJECT_INDEPENDENT">'independent' modeling projects</a> is
      typical, and it is safe for most applications.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>However, it may be necessary to work with projects that are directly
      linked to default database files, for instance, to have any changes in
      default (kernel) database immediately affect calculations within the
      project. It is less simple to create such a new <a href="#PROJECT_LINKED">"linked"
        project</a> because in this case, you cannot use the Elements Dialog,
      and you must know what is contained in various kernel database files in
      order to make a proper selection. It is recommended to proceed in the
      following steps creating such a new project. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p> Define the list of independent components (IC) necessary for
          describing stoichiometry of the system. Find out which IComp database
          files contain records for all required independent components. Define
          which phase types (aqueous, gas, solid (solutions), sorption) must be
          included. Check which GEMS default thermodynamic database files are to
          be linked to your new project.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Start GEM-Selektor&nbsp;and go into "Computation of Equilibria" mode.
          In the Modelling Project dialog, activate the option "Make a new
          project by linking files from the default database", then click on the
          "New Project..." button to create a new linked project.</p>

Cloning



        a New (Expanded) Project from the Existing One</font></h3>
    <p>It is not possible to duplicate a modeling project simply by making a
      copy of its folder under a different name. A special mode of GEM-Selektor
      can be used for this purpose. In this mode, either an exact copy of the
      project with a different name can be obtained, or a 'cloned' project can
      be expanded by adding one or more Independent Components (respectively,
      more chemical species, phases, and compositions) from the default database
      supplied together with the program package. <br>
    </p>
    <p>To expand (clone) a project into a new one, go into "Equilibria Mode" and
      in the Modeling Projects dialog, activate the option "Create a new project
      using the selected one..."; select the project in the list; and click the
      "New Project" button. In the appearing record key dialog, enter a new
      project name and a comment, and click "Ok".</p>
    <p>You are how in the Elements Dialog, the same as that appearing when a new
      project is created (<a href="gems_elements.html">more...</a>). The
      difference is that the Independent Components selected in the original
      project are now visible as pressed buttons that cannot be deselected. You
      can simply do nothing and click "Ok" to produce a copy of the original
      project with a different name - this makes sense, for instance, to
      "freeze" the results at certain stage e.g. for reporting, or to produce a
      GEMS test project case (by deleting some system or process records, adding
      comments and descriptions, and so on). <br>
    </p>
    <p>However, a more typical case would be to add some elements to the new
      project while retaining setups and results that have already been done.
      Many users tend to begin with relatively simple systems and extend them at
      later stages, perhaps, using data from a 'specific' default database (this
      needs first a re-configuration of database access <a href="gems_elements.html">as
        described here</a>). Select additional elements and click "Ok" to
      proceed. This will get you through the "Setup of aqueous and gas
      phases..." dialog, then the program will ask you for confirming insertion
      of new IComp, DComp, ReacDC, Phase and Compos records into the project
      database. You can accept all insertions to be done automatically
      (recommended option) or review each action one-by-one (option for
      experts). The list of automatically or manually rejected records can be
      found in the file "DiscardedRecords.txt" in the same folder where GEMS3
      executable file is located. As the last step, the program will update
      internal indexation in all existing SysEq records in the project in order
      to make the newly inserted components and phases accessible in the system
      definitions; this can take time if there are many SysEq records to
      update.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>When the cloning/expansion process is finished, the "Single System"
      dialog appears (<a href="gems_sys.html#HOWTO">more...</a>), where you can
      check, re-calculate, and save the existing systems (SysEq records), or
      clone/create new ones. Note that, after the project has been expanded,
      existing SysEq records must be re-checked and re-calculated before the
      equilibrium speciation and dual solution can be viewed again. <br>
    </p>
    <p>As an alternative, it is always possible to extend an existing project
      with more Independent Components, Dependent Components, and Phases without
      cloning it (<a href="#PROJECT_EXTEND">more...</a>).</p>

    <p>Any binary GEMS database file, as such, has a <tt>.pdb</tt> file name

      contains indexing information (record keys with references to record
      locations in the <tt>.pdb</tt> file) to speed up search in the database.
      The second element of the file name is always the same as the project
      (folder) name (<tt>"Carbonat"</tt>). The first element of the file name is
      a GEM-Selektor module name that can process the records stored in this

      thermodynamic and composition data are shown. In the right column, the
      file <tt>projec.Carbonat.pdb</tt> keeps the project system structure
      lists and configuration (there is just one record <tt>"Carbonat:My1stProject"</tt>
      ); the file <tt>syseq.Carbonat.pdb</tt>&nbsp;will collect all the records
      with calculated equilibrium states (here still empty). <br>
    </p>
    <p> Files&nbsp;<tt>proces.Carbonat.pdb</tt> and <tt>gtdemo.Carbonat.pdb</tt>&nbsp;

      contain your Project Simulator and Graphic/table Demo Sampler records,
      respectively, and <tt>sdref.Carbonat.pdb</tt> file will keep your SDref
      records with bibliographic data or customized scripts. These files are
      also empty at the beginning. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Note that all your work done on this modelling project will be stored
      exclusively into <tt>.pdb</tt> files in the project directory, and
      nowhere else. Thus, you can backup your work any time simply by zipping
      the whole project directory; this zip file (e.g. <tt>Carbonat.zip</tt>)
      can be sent to your colleague with whom you would like to share your
      models. You are welcome to send it&nbsp; also to the developers of
      GEM-Selektor in the case of bug reporting or if you wish to contribute to
      the GEMS Kernel database, test suite, or tutorials. <br>
    </p>
    <p>As seen in the left column of the above table, <tt>icomp.*, dcomp.*,
        reacdc.*, phase.*</tt> and <tt>compos.*</tt> files in the project
      directory are not empty. During creation of the new project, GEM-Selektor
      used the list of selected independent components (Ca, Mn, Fe, C, Na, Cl,
      O, H, Zz)&nbsp; first to copy the respective IComp records to <tt>icomp.Carbonat.pdb</tt>
      file. Then the program searched the whole accessible part of the default
      database for such Dependent Components and compositions that would
      completely fit into this stoichiometry basis; the conforming DComp,
      ReacDC, and Compos records were also copied from the default- to the
      project database files. Next, the program checked all the Phase
      definitions available in the default database against the lists of copied
      DComp and ReacDC records and discarded all phases that contain at least
      one species not conformant with the project system stoichiometry basis.
      The record keys of discarded multi-component phases have been written to
      the diagnostic&nbsp;<tt>DiscardedRecords.txt</tt> file (located in the
      same folder where the GEMS executable file resides). This file can be used
      for checking, which phase definitions can be copied later on manually to
      the project and rebuilt there (instead of creating them from scratch).<br>
    </p>
    Finally, the program has assembled the definitions of aqueous and gas phases
    from the DComp and ReacDC records previously copied into the project
    database, and attached all Phase record keys and all the DComp/ReacDC record
    keys referenced from the phase definitions to the project system structure.
    Note that those records for Dependent Components that were not referenced in
    any Phase definition copied into the project, were not included in the
    project system. To activate such Dependent Components (e.g., minerals), you
    will have to create Phase records for them in the "Thermodynamic Database"
    mode and then open the project, which will be extended automatically. &nbsp;
    &nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    In your new project folder, the program has created several empty files (for
    <tt>rtparm, sdref, proces, gtdemo</tt> and <tt>syseq</tt> modules) to store
    the records that you are going to create when working with the modelling
    project. Although one database file per module is present in the project
    directory, you always can create new files (as described in the <a href="gems_tdbase.html">Database
      Management manual</a>). In doing so, we would recommend to add another
    part to the file name, for example, <tt>reacdc.Carbonat.MySpecies.pdb</tt>
    or <tt>reacdc.Carbonat.MyCompos.pdb</tt>. Note that records in these
    additional files will not be visible to the project system definition until
    you <a href="#HOWTO_EXPAND">reconfigure the project</a>. It would be wise
    to have some additional thermodynamic database files never linked to the
    project system definition, just kept for some supplementary data or
    calculations; anyway, the files reside in the project directory and will not
    be lost during backups.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    In principle, it is possible to have any other file types in the project
    folder, such as saved images, spreadsheets, texts and so on, where the user
    keeps reporting or external calculations related to this project. GEMS only
    looks there for .ndx and .pdb files; as long as they are intact, it should
    work fine. We recommend making backups of the project folder that you
    currently work with at least twice per work day in order to minimize
    possible loss of time and data due to seldom cases of the project definition
    record corruption.&nbsp; <br>

    <p> It is possible to extend an existing modeling project without cloning it

        <p>It is always easier to copy existing records from the default
          database or use them as templates for creating new records with "Save
          As..." or "New/Clone" menu commands than create new records 'from
          scratch'.&nbsp; </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To temporarily link default database files, use "Database Files"
          "Configure" menu command. To copy records, use "Record List" "Copy..."
          menu command, and change at least one character in the last record key
          field for each copied record (it is not possible to have two records
          with the same key). </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p> Add records to your project database extension in the following
          order: <a href="gm_icomp.html">IComp</a>; <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a>;
          <a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a>; <a href="gm_phase.html">Phase</a>;
          <a href="gm_compos.html">Compos</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> After remaking <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a>,&nbsp; <a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC,</a>
          and <a href="gm_compos.html">Compos</a> records, it's advisable to
          re-calculate them.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> Backup your newly created or modified database records by exporting
          them into text files.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> If you need to copy many records from default database to your
          database extension file, export them first to a text file. Then edit
          this text file for changing the last field of record keys to avoid
          possible "duplicate record key" errors. Finally, link your project
          extension file only and import into it the records from the edited
          text file.</p>

        Project and Default Database Files</span></h1>
    <h2><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><a name="FILES"></a>7.
        Project File Configuration Dialog</span></h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>This dialog appears if the option
      "Change file configuration of the selected project" has been activated
      before opening or creating a modeling project (<a style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"
        href="#HOWTO_REOPEN">more...</a>). In a tree-like view, it shows two
      sets of database files linked to the project: "Kernel" and
      &lt;ProjectName&gt;, the former corresponds to location
      "/Resources/DB.default" that comes with the program, and the latter - to
      the location "/Library/gems3/projects/&lt;ProjectName&gt;". Each entry
      expands into sub-entries corresponding to database chains (e.g. IComp,
      ReacDC, ...). Expanding an entry shows files available for this data type;
      currently linked files are highlighted. Each file entry consists of a
      'nickname' and a full name of the file. 'Nicknames' of linked files are
      saved in the Project record (in this way, the program knows which files to
      open when the project is used next time). Changing file configuration of
      the project means that some files are un-linked, or some others are linked
      in addition, both actions done with a mouse click.</p>
    <p>Typically, this dialog is used in two situations. <br>
    </p>
    <p>One is when a new database file has been created in the project folder
      (e.g. to keep some ReacDC records added by the user in an independent
      project). These records become available in the Equilibria Calculation
      mode only after the new file is linked to the project through this dialog.
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>Another situation is when a new "linked" project is created; then the
      user must select consistent parts of the default database to be accessible
      from the project in Equilibria Calculation mode.&nbsp; <br>
