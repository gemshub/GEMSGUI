Please, copy here the html and image files in order to generate a new help database. 

How to compile Gems Help Collection database (see also file HOWTO-Build-help.txt).

Source HTML and image files must be all located in the subfolder "/Resources/doc/html" (no subfolders inside!).

There are two configuration files provided: "gems3helpconfig.toc"  and "gems3helpconfig.qhcp". 
A third configuration file "gems3helpconfig.qhp" will be automatically generated when the user goes into GEMS 
Preferences dialog and clicks there the "Generate from source" button. This operation copies the content of 
"gems3helpconfig.toc" file into the section <toc> of the "gems3helpconfig.qhp"; then collects the list of all 
HTML files and image files present in the source directory into the <files> section; and then scans all HTML 
files for anchors collecting them into the <index> section of the "gems3helpconfig.qhp" file. 
Next, the qcollectiongenerator utility program from Qt library is called with the "gems3helpconfig.qhcp" file name 
as command line parameter in order to generate (using the "gems3helpconfig.qhp" file) the help collection database 
file "gems3help.qch" and its header "gems3help.qhc". 

To use the updated help database: exit GEMS; locate files "gems3help.qch" and "gems3help.qhc" in the subfolder
"/Resources/doc/html"; move them to the subfolder "/Resources/help" (replacing older versions of these files); 
and start GEMS3 again.  

File gems3helpconfig.toc contains an XML code describing what the GEMS Help viewer shows in the "Contents" tab. 
To change  "Contents", edit the file. 
To remove a section, locate it (it begins with <section> and ands with </section> and delete it or move in another 
place in the file. This has no effect on the actual content of the help database, only on access through the "Contents"
tab. 
To add an entry to a (sub)section called "Title text" pointing to "link" (file or anchor name), add a line 
	<section title="Title text" ref="link"> </section> 
at the appropriate level of hierarchy.
To delete an entry, locate it and delete the whole line (from <section ... to </section>. 

To test the generated collection file independently of GEMS, cd in the directory with the help database and start the 
Qt Assistant program by a command line like:

~/QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/4.8.0/bin/assistant -collectionFile gems3help.qhc
