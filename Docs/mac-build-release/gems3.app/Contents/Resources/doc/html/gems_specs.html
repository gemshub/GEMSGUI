<h2>Technical Information</h2>

<hr size="2" width="100%">
<p>GEM-Selektor v.3 (GEMS3) is written in C/C++. It has a modern
windowed multi-document Graphical User's Interface (GUI) that uses the
functionality of Qt v.4 (v.5) UI Toolkit for desktops in the form of
dynamically-linked libraries and plugins.<br>
<br>
Qt is a cross-platform framework that allows the same source code to
be compiled and run on all major desktop PC platforms, as well as on
some mobile devices. Desktop variants of Qt4 or Qt5 SDK, available under LGPL v.2.1
licence, can be downloaded from http://qt-project.org.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
The GEMS3 executable code is produced by linking together Qt dynamic
load libraries and plugins provided in Qt4 (Qt5) with the following parts
compiled with the GNU C++ compilers:<br>
</p>



<ul>


  <li><b>GEMS3K</b> code for solving chemical equilibrium systems by
Gibbs Energy Minimization (more ...); uses the Jama TNT C++ library
(NIST) for numerical algebra, but no Qt functionality. GEMS3K code also
includes the TSolMod class library of built-in models of mixing in
phases-solutions.</li>
  <li><b>GEMS-GUI</b>
code, which contains all the specific code for
simple thermodynamic calculations, database management modules, widgets
and dialogs. This part requires Qt headers for compilation; is is based
in part on the work of the Qwt project (http://qwt.sf.net). It also
uses parts of the SUPCRT92 code (translated from Fortran to C/C++), and
parts of the TSolMod code.</li>
</ul>


<p>The GEMS3 package also contains a Resources/ folder with
configuration files, default thermodynamic database, help database, and
some pdf documentation files. Set of icons used in GEM-Selektor GUI:

<h3>Platform-specific information</h3>


<h4>Windows XP/7/8</h4>


<p>GEM-Selektor is built using Qt4.8.4 (or Qt5.0.2) with the MinGW port of
GNU C++ compiler and linker. It comes as a self-extracting installer
file&nbsp; having the name</p>


<p>&nbsp; <tt>Gems&lt;ver&gt;-&lt;revGUI&gt;.&lt;revG3K&gt;-win32-install.sfx.exe
</tt></p>


<p>where&nbsp; <tt>&lt;ver&gt;</tt>&nbsp; stands for version number
(e.g. 3.2), <tt>&lt;revGUI&gt;</tt> is the SVN trunk revision number
for the GEMS-Vizor part, and <tt>&lt;revG3K&gt;</tt> is the SVN trunk
revision number for the GEMS3K code part. The installer (ca. 13 Mb
size) is prepared using the 7-zip SFX Maker out of a 7-zip archive that
contains a compressed folder <tt>Gems3-app\</tt> and files <tt>INSTALL.windows.txt,
rungems3.bat</tt> and <tt>Readme3.txt</tt>. The <tt>
INSTALL.windows.txt</tt> file describes how to install GEMS3 on a
Windows PC.</p>


<p>When installed, GEM-Selektor occupies ca. 50 Mb on hard disk; a
modeling project can occupy 1 to 100 Mb depending on the size of
project chemical system and number of process-generated records.
Therefore, at least 1 Gb of free HDD space is necessary (SSD disks work
much faster). The program runs, in principle, on any PC with Intel or
AMD processor - from netbooks to desktops - but for better performance,
a quad-core i7 or similar processor with 4 Gb RAM or more is
recommended. The multi-document GUI of GEMS3 looks nice on color
displays with 1600 x 900 or higher resolution.</p>


<h4>Mac OS X (10.6, 10.7, 10.8)</h4>


<p>GEM-Selektor is built using Qt4.8.4 (or Qt5.0.2) which requires the GNU
C++ compiler and linker (clang for Qt5 variant) provided in the actual version of Xcode. GEMS3
comes as a disk image file having the name</p>


<p>&nbsp; <tt>Gems&lt;ver&gt;-&lt;revGUI&gt;.&lt;revG3K&gt;-OSX-x86-64.dmg
</tt></p>


<p>where&nbsp; <tt>&lt;ver&gt;</tt>&nbsp; stands for version number
(e.g. 3.2), <tt>&lt;revGUI&gt;</tt> is the SVN trunk revision number
for the GEMS-Vizor part, and <tt>&lt;revG3K&gt;</tt> is the SVN trunk
revision number for the GEMS3K code part. The installer (ca. 22 Mb
size) is prepared using the <tt>macdeployqt</tt> utility of Qt SDK
from the (updated) <tt>/Applications/gems3.app</tt> application that
has usual folder structure, as required by OS X.&nbsp;&nbsp; The folder
<tt>/Applications/gems3.app/Contents/Resources/</tt> contains a file <tt>INSTALL.macosx.txt</tt>
that describes how to install GEMS3 on Mac.</p>


<p>When installed, GEM-Selektor occupies ca. 57 Mb on hard disk; a
modeling project can occupy 1 to 100 Mb depending on the size of
project chemical system and number of process-generated records.
Therefore, at least 1 Gb of free HDD space is necessary (SSD disks work
much faster). The program runs, in principle, on any Mac with Intel
processor and OS X 10.6 or higher. For better performance, an iMac, Mac
Pro, or Mac Book Pro quad-core i7 or similar processor with 4 Gb RAM or
more is recommended. The multi-document GUI of GEMS3 looks nice on
color displays with 1600 x 900 or higher resolution.</p>


<h4>Linux</h4>


<p>GEM-Selektor is built using Qt4.8.4 (or Qt5.0.2)  which uses the native GNU
C++ compiler and linker. The GEMS3 comes as a tar.gzip (tgz) archive file
having the name</p>


<p>&nbsp;<tt>
Gems&lt;ver&gt;-&lt;revGUI&gt;.&lt;revG3K&gt;-linux-x86-&lt;bits&gt;.tgz</tt></p>


<p>where&nbsp; <tt>&lt;ver&gt;</tt>&nbsp; stands for version number
(e.g. 3.2), <tt>&lt;revGUI&gt;</tt> is the SVN trunk revision number
for the GEMS-Vizor part, <tt>&lt;revG3K&gt;</tt> is the SVN trunk
revision number for the GEMS3K code part, and <tt>&lt;bits&gt;</tt>
stands for 32 or 64 depending on the linux distribution. The installer
(ca. 16 Mb size) is prepared on the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32 or 64 by
compressing the folder "<tt>~/Gems3-app/</tt>" application that
contains the "<tt>Resources/</tt>" subfolder, <tt>gems3</tt>
executable, and binary Qt4 libraries and plugins used by gems3. The
folder also contains the <tt>gems3.bash</tt> and <tt>gems3.sh</tt>
batch files for launching GEMS3 program, and the
<tt> INSTALL.linux.txt </tt>file. Installation of GEMS3 on linux does
not require
sudo or root privileges.&nbsp; </p>


<p>When installed, GEM-Selektor occupies ca. 40 Mb on hard disk; a
modeling project can occupy 1 to 100 Mb depending on the size of
project chemical system and number of process-generated records.
Therefore, at least 1 Gb of free HDD space is necessary (SSD disks work
much faster). The program runs, in principle, on any PC with Intel
processor. For better performance, a PC with quad-core i7 or similar
processor with 4 Gb RAM or more is recommended. The multi-document GUI
of GEMS3 looks nice on color displays with 1600 x 900 or higher
resolution.</p>


<p>Although the GEMS3 installer for linux is prepared on Ubuntu linux,
it runs on any other linux distribution for the same architecture, e.g.
on Kubuntu linux 11 and higher, fedora linux 15 and higher, and
openSuSE linux 12 and higher. The reason is that the installer contains
all the necessary binary files form Qt, and is simply a tarball zip
archive that is supposed to run in the home directory of the user with
normal privileges.</p>


<p>On some linuxes, the default font size in GEMS module windows may
appear odd (too small or too large). This can be fixed in Preferences
Dialog. Start GEMS3 and click "Help" "Preferences" menu command, then
click the "Change font..." button.</p>
