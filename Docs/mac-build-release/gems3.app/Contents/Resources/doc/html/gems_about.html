    <h2><a name="PAGE_ABOUT"></a>ABOUT GEM-SELEKTOR<br>
    </h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">GEM-Selektor version 3</span> (GEMS3) is
      a Gibbs Energy Minimization program package for interactive thermodynamic
      modeling of heterogeneous aquatic (geo)chemical systems, especially those
      involving metastability and dispersity of mineral phases, solid solution -
      aqueous solution equilbria, and adsorption/ion exchange. Processes of
      irreversible chemical mass transfer can be simulated using the principles
      of local and partial equilibrium. </p>
    <p style="margin: 12px 0px; text-indent: 0px;">The GEMS3 package includes
      the imported SUPCRT92 code (Johnson et al., 1992) and a built-in (default)
      thermodynamic database in both thermochemical and reaction formats.
      'Kernel' part of this database corresponds to the current edition of the
      Nagra-PSI database (Hummel et al., 2002). The 'Complementary' part
      consists of the imported SUPCRT (Slop98.dat) database (Shock et al.,
      1997), commonly used in hydrothermal geochemistry. There are popular
      extension thermodynamic databases for GEMS3 that can be downloaded from
      web sites of their developers, for example Cemdata18
      (https://www.empa.ch/cemdata) and MINES19
      (https://geoinfo.nmt.edu/mines-tdb/). </p>
    <p style="margin: 12px 0px; text-indent: 0px;">A standalone variant of GEM
      solver - <span style="font-weight: bold;">GEMS3K</span> - is also
      provided separately for use in coupled reactive transport modeling and
      related applications. The same numerical kernel (enhanced with the
      interpreter of GEMS Phase scripts) runs inside of the GEMS3 code.</p>
    <p style="margin: 12px 0px; text-indent: 0px;">The GEMS3 code is written in
      C/C++, using the community-license version of the Qt4/Qt5/Qt6 GUI
      framework (https://qt.io) and the GNU gcc or clang C++ compiler, which
      makes GEMS3 a cross-platform software for all major Linux, Mac OS X and
      Windows systems.<br>
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 12px 0px; text-indent: 0px;">The GEMS3K code (the
      numerical kernel of GEMS3) is a C++ program without any GUI, only with
      ASCII file I/O, but capable to be compiled and executed also on parallel
      architectures. GEMS3K uses the public domain JAMA/C++ linear algebra
      package by Roldan Pozo (http://math.nist.gov/tnt). Both codes also use
      JSON parsers json.hpp by Niels Lohmann (https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
      and optionally simdjson by Daniel Lemire (https://github.com/simdjson).</p>

    <h2><a name="OVERVIEW"></a>OVERVIEW</h2>
    <p>GEM-Selektor is a Gibbs Energy Minimization program package for
      interactive thermodynamic modeling of heterogeneous aquatic (geo)chemical
      systems, especially those involving metastability and dispersity of
      mineral phases, solid solution - aqueous solution equilbria, and
      adsorption/ion exchange. Includes a built-in (default) thermodynamic
      database in both thermochemical and reaction formats, and an advanced
      multi-document graphical user interface with context-sensitive help
      system.</p>
    <p>This chapter is for people who have never used&nbsp; GEM-Selektor or
      other Gibbs energy minimisation codes, and, perhaps, have never done
      geochemical modelling. If you are already familiar with the subject and
      just try to learn a particular feature or technical information, you can
      probably skip three sections below. <br>
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3> <a name="WHATIS"></a>What is GEM-Selektor?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p> GEM-Selektor (GEMS) is a geochemical modelling code. It uses an
          advanced convex programming method of Gibbs energy minimization (GEM)
          implemented as an efficient Interior Points Method (IPM) in the GEMS3K
          kernel module.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Using GEMS, you can compute an equilibrium phase assemblage and
          speciation in a complex chemical system with many phases-solutions
          from its total bulk elemental composition at given temperature and
          pressure (optionally, subject&nbsp; to additional kinetic
          metastability constraints).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>TSolMod The code includes a TSolMod library of built-in phase models
          of non-ideal mixing, relevant to a wide range of applications in
          geochemistry</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Chemical interactions involving solids, solid solutions, metls,
          gas/fluid mixture, aqueous electrolyte, (non-)electrostatic surface
          complexation, and ion exchange can be considered simultaneously in the
          chemical elemental stoichiometry (+ electrical charge) of the system,
          i.e. without any mass balance constraints for ligands or surface
          sites.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>GEMS package includes a built-in write-protected default chemical
          thermodynamic data base, selected parts of which are automatically
          copied into your&nbsp; modelling project data base upon creation of
          the modeling project, where the thermodynamic and compositional input
          data are immediately available for calculation of equilibrium states.
          This data base can be extended or corrected at any time, and changes
          will have no effect on the default database supplied with the program.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Within a modeling project, all you have to do is, in principle, to
          provide a recipe, i.e. the bulk composition of your system and,
          possibly, exclude some irrelevant species and phases and set
          mestability constraints, then start GEM calculation of equilibrium
          state.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If necessary, the standard-state thermodynamic data will be
          automatically converted to temperature/ pressure of interest&nbsp;
          before computing the equilibrium state using several techniques as
          appropriate for soilds, gases, aqueous and surface species.&nbsp; </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Using GEMS, you can simulate various mass-transfer processes and
          reaction paths, such as titrations, mixing, weathering, or sequential
          reactors, controlled by a "process extent" master variable(s) used in
          the process simulator scripts. Results of such "process simulations"
          can easily be tabulated, plotted (also at run time), copy-pasted to
          other programs, or printed into text files.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In addition to the common "primal solution", i.e. equilibrium
          chemical speciation, the GEM IPM algorithm always calculates a "dual
          solution", i.e. chemical potentials of stoichiometry units (elements)
          in equilibrium state. By comparing primal and dual solutions, it
          becomes easy to retrieve pe (Eh), pH, fugacities of gases, very low
          activities or concentrations of dissolved species, as well as to
          estimate unknown thermodynamic properties of mixing or of end-members
          in a solid solution - aqueous solution system.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Overall, using the GEM-Selektor code will bring you all the power of
      advanced chemical thermodynamic modelling, leading to high efficiency in
      interpreting even complex subsurface- or hydrothermal aquatic systems. Of
      course, some learning and exercise will be needed. To make it easier, we
      strive to provide a help tutorial and a set of test projects .</p>

    <h3> <a name="WHATISNOT"></a>What is GEM-Selektor not?</h3>
    <h4><big> </big>GEMS3 cannot replace your knowledge of physical chemistry.</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>It's hardly possible to set up meaningful problems in geochemical
        thermodynamic modelling and interprete results without a good basic
        understanding of aquatic chemistry and chemical thermodynamics, even
        though the underlying concepts are very general and quite simple. Taking
        a course in the above subjects and/or reading a few good textbooks such
        as (Anderson, 2005; Nordstrom and Muños, 1994; Stumm and Morgan, 1996)
        would therefore be a valuable investment, helping you to maximize the
        usefulness of GEMS modeling.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4>GEMS3 is not a substitute for creative research.</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Geochemical thermodynamic modelling (as almost any modelling) should be
        regarded as nothing else than a tool&nbsp; helping you in interpreting
        your geochemical data and in reaching a deeper understanding of how the
        chemical system works. As with any tool, using GEMS3 can be either
        creative or a waste of time.<big> </big></p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4>GEMS3 cannot formulate chemical modeling problems and interpret results.<br>
    </h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Very often, first GEMS3 modeling runs yield rather unexpected results,
        urging a re-consideration of some concepts or assumptions.. This is
        normal; a few more modeling iterations will soon give you much more
        confidence in your data and model predictions. It makes no sense is to
        start modeling just having the raw data, without a working hypothesis to
        be verified; clearly, no interpretation of results is possible in this
        case. GEMS3 is just a tool for checking how realistic your ideas about
        the system are.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4>GEMS3 cannot simulate processes in far-from-equilibrium systems.</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Some natural, biological or technical systems, especially at short time
        scales, exist far from equilibrium or in a transient state. In such
        cases, fundamental assumptions about local and partial equilibria cannot
        be applied and, therefore, methods of equilibrium chemical thermodynamic
        cannot be used. Before doing any model calculations with GEMS3 or
        another speciation code, first question to ask is whether the concept of
        local/partial equilibrium is adequate for the system of interest.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4>GEMS3 is not a tool for plotting phase diagrams.</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Plotting phase diagrams is a popular exercise in chemical
        thermodynamics in petrology or metallurgy, and in aquatic chemistry as
        well. This often requires a very serious simplification of the chemical
        system (to make it observable in 2D or 3D coordinate space). A number of
        tools is avaialble for this purpose (Perplex, Thermocalc, PHREEQPLOT
        etc.). GEMS modeling, however, is aimed at quantifying the effects of
        equilibration at given (sequence of) T,P, and bulk composition in full
        speciation complexity of the system, perhaps under many additional
        kinetic, metastability and/or dispersity constraints. GEMS3 batch
        calculations can be designed in a way that directly produces phase,
        activity, or reaction-path diagrams.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4>GEMS3 cannot create thermodynamic data or assess their quality.</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Any chain is as strong as it's weakest link. Likewise, any modeling
        result is not better than the input compositional and thermodynamic
        data. In the past 30 years, a considerable progress has been made in
        compilation of internally consistent thermodynamic data bases, including
        those supplied as the default database with GEMS code. However, no
        database covers everything relevant for all possible applications.
        Therefore, it is usually necessary to extend it with the standard-state
        data for some missing species or minerals, or extend T,P correction
        range. Although GEMS3 provides a number of tools for extension of the
        project thermodynamic database, it cannot replace an expert in critical
        compilation, matching and retrieval of thermodynamic data.</p>

      </font></h3>
    In most geochemical modelling studies (except maybe simple test examples)
    the user will need to extend thermodynamic database with some new chemical
    species and phases, or change some thermodynamic properties of them in a
    consistent way. A modeling project concept implemented in GEMS lets the user
    performing such modifications conveniently and continue thermodynamic
    modeling straight away: already created records with input chemical recipes
    and output equilibrium speciation will be updated or extended automatically.
    <br>
    <br>
    All input data and results of GEM calculations are automatically stored in
    the modeling project data base files and nowhere else. The user can zip her
    modelling project folder for back-up or to share it with colleagues. Anyone
    who has (the same or newer) GEMS3 code installed on her PC can unpack that
    project and run it, as the user would continue running it on her own
    desktop. &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    GEMS3 has a complementary structure of thermodynamic database. The standard
    molar data for chemical species are kept either in thermochemical
    (optionally equation-of-state) DComp format, or as reactions defining
    standard molar properties of a given species via that of the reaction and of
    other species involved (ReacDC format). In both formats, many data
    consistency checks are performed. Data of both formats, saved into database
    records, can be immediately used in GEM calculations of chemical equilibria.<br>
    <br>
    Unlike command-driven or batch-input-file geochemical codes (e.g., PHREEQC,
    EQ3/6, GWB, ChemApp, Selektor-C, HCh), GEM-Selektor is an interactive
    modular package in which computational modules share data objects in memory,
    manipulated by the data base maintenance module. GEMS is written in C/C++
    and has a modern multi-document mouse-menu-driven GUI (graphical user's
    interface) based on the Qt GUI Toolkit, which also provides GEMS with
    cross-platform portability: The source code of GEMS can be compiled and
    executed on most Intel-based Linux/Unix, Windows, and Mac OS X desktop
    platforms. &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    In GEM-Selektor, no batch files with input data are necessary. The program
    operation is fully interactive, controlled by mouse clicking on toolbar
    icons or menu items, selecting record keys from lists, or entering data
    directly into spreadsheet-like screen forms. Your entered or calculated data
    is automatically stored in the project data base, where it is kept
    accessible for subsequent calculations or data sampling, plotting or
    exporting. This interactive functionality makes the work flow of geochemical
    modeling more efficient than ever before. <br>
    <br>
    Almost all kinds of data accessible in GEM-Selektor windows using the data
    object labels can be printed into ASCII text files using the simple print
    formatting scripts. A collection of template printing scripts is provided
    for the user' convenience; all scripts can easily be customized and saved
    into your project data base. The data in module window pages can also be
    copy-pasted to/from most other spreadsheet or text editing programs. Some
    results of computations can also be exported into csv and VTK format files.<br>
    <br>
    GEM-Selektor GUI provides the user with a context-sensitive hypertext
    runtime help. In most cases, the tooltips (popping up upon hovering the
    cursor over almost every button or data field) are sufficient. Direct access
    to separate HelpWindow with documentation is possible from any dialog,
    screen form, and even a single data field cell on any screen form. The
    HelpWindow has the industry-standard browsing and search functionality. <br>
    <br>
    GEM-Selektor numerical kernel GEMS3K implements an Interior Points Method
    (IPM) module for non-linear minimization of total Gibbs energy of the
    heterogeneous multi-phase chemical system, with improved accuracy, mass
    balance precision, convergence, speed, and extended input data diagnostics
    to meet the needs of the reactive-transport modelling applications in
    performance assessment of radioactive waste disposal,&nbsp; aquatic
    chemistry, and hydrogeochemistry. The IPM module uses fast and efficient
    linear algebra solvers from the JAMA C++ TNT package from NIST.<br>
    <br>
    The GEMS3K standalone program implementing the enhanced GEM IPM algorithm is
    now available open-source from this web site under the LGPL v.3 license.
    GEMS3K has no GUI and can read/write input/output data from/to text files,
    as well as exchange the data in computer memory. It can also interpolate
    thermodynamic data for chemical species for changing temperature and/or
    pressure. The purpose of GEMS3K is to facilitate and promote development of
    coupled codes for modelling reactive mass transport using the "operator
    splitting" approach with GEM chemical equilibria solver. GEMS3K C/C++ code
    is small, fast, and meets all requirements of such coupled codes including
    MPI parallelization and high-performance computing for realistic 2D or 3D
    transport simulations.&nbsp;
