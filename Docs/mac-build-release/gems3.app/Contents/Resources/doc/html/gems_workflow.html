    <h2><a name="EQ_HOWTO_INTRO"></a>Introduction: How To Calculate Equilibria
      in GEMS<br>
    </h2>
    <p>For "learning by doing", please go to <a target="_top" href="gems_tutorial.html">GEMS3
        Tutorial</a> and leave the HelpViewer window open; drag it to the second
      monitor, if you have two monitors. Work with GEMS3 code, following advice
      in Tutorial, whichprovides for most of the necessary skills. </p>
    <p>The GEMS3 code has two main modi of operation: <a href="#EQCALCMODE">"Equilibria
        Calculation"</a> and <a href="#DBMANMODE">"Database Management"</a>. In
      the GEMS3 main frame window, you can switch between them using two icons
      located just below the "Modules" menu item. Watch tooltips on the
      icons.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>The setup of chemical modelling problems in GEM approach is different
      from that used in the LMA- based codes like PHREEQC. The Law of Mass
      Action (LMA) models differentiate between the "master species", whose
      concentrations go directly into the material balance equations, and the
      "product species" defined by their LMA expressions and equilibrium
      constants of reactions with the master species (see more about that
      in&nbsp; <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/g_litref.html#1999PAR/APP">[1999PAR/APP]</a>).
      <br> </p>
    <p>In GEM approach, no "master" and "product" species are distinguished. The
      stoichiometry of all gaseous, aqueous, liquid, solid or surface species is
      written as chemical formulae in terms of&nbsp; Independent Components
      (IC). The term "independent component" must be understood as an
      independent extensive thermodynamic variable representing the total molar
      quantity in the system (typically number of moles of chemical element in
      the total bulk composition). All chemical species which can exist in the
      system are then defined as "Dependent Components" (DC) as they are
      composed of stoichiometrically&nbsp; fixed&nbsp; quantities of IC.&nbsp;
      The DC stoichiometries, multiplied by the number of moles of DC (or
      species) <i>x<sub>j</sub></i> , all go directly into mass balance
      relative to the total number of moles of&nbsp; IC <i>b<sub>i</sub></i>&nbsp;
in
      the system (bulk composition). The stability of any species (DC) at <i>T,
        P</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; of interest is defined by its standard molar (or molal
      in case of aqueous and surface species) Gibbs energy of formation <i>G<sup>o</sup><sub>j</sub>&nbsp;</i>
      from IC, these are usually chemical elements at selected standard states
      and charge. The Gibbs energies, together with the activity terms in the
      respective phases, compose chemical potentials, then multiplied by <i>x<sub>j</sub></i>
      &nbsp;and summed up into the total Gibbs energy <i>G</i> (<i>x</i>
      )&nbsp; of the whole system. The GEM algorithms seek for values of&nbsp; <i>x<sub>j
          &nbsp;</sub></i>such that, for the imposed material balance and
      optional metastability constraints, a minimum is provided for <i>G</i> (<i>x</i>
      ) (see <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/g_litref.html#1997KAR/CHU">[1997KAR/CHU]</a>,
      for more information). <br>
    </p>
    <p>Thus, to set up a single GEM chemical equilibrium problem, the following
      input items must be provided: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> a list of independent components;</li>
      <li> a list of phases that may appear at the equilibrium state;</li>
      <li> a list of species within each phase;</li>
      <li> standard molar/molal Gibbs energy function values at <i>T, P</i>&nbsp;
of
        interest for all species;</li>
      <li> equations for calculation of activity coefficients of species in the
        non-ideal multi-component phases;</li>
      <li> optionally, metastability restrictions for some species;</li>
      <li> bulk chemical composition of the whole system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many irreversible processes (such as titrations, mixing or weathering)
      can be simulated in GEM approach (like in the LMA techniques) by
      generating a discrete sequence of equilibrium states at&nbsp; changing
      bulk composition, constraints, or state variables of the chemical system.
      The computed speciation, activities, dissolved concentrations, etc. can
      then be plotted against the varying input parameters. <br>
      <br>
      <br>

    <h2> <a name="EQCALCMODE"></a>"Equilibria Calculation" Mode</h2>
    This is the usual mode for calculation of geochemical models using GEMS3
    package.&nbsp; Such calculations always refer to the <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P3300">thermodynamic
database
      </a>which contains input data about stability of all species at wide range
    of temperature, pressure and compositions of the systems. At present level,
    such "condensed chemical knowledge" databases are quite extensive, although
    most of published databases still&nbsp; cannot be simply mixed for&nbsp;
    modeling calculations before special procedures for matching thermodynamic
    data have been applied. Moreover, any meaningful geochemical modeling
    problem in fact uses only part of thermodynamic database, restricted either
    by stoichiometry of the system (we do not always model systems with rare
    earth elements); or by phase types (not all systems require consideration of
    adsorption or multi-component non-ideal solid solutions), or by the range of
    temperature/ pressure conditions (many high-PT minerals are not considered
    in the low-temperature geachemical speciation models). Therefore, it may not
    be convenient always to browse the whole thermodynamic database having 90%
    of species or phases switched off! To avoid this, a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Modeling
      Project"</span><a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P3400">
    </a>concept has been introduced.
    <p>In general terms, the system profile is a template which defines a subset
      of thermodynamic database and certain default configuration of chemical
      systems used for setting up certain class of geochemical models. This
      template is normally created by the user and stored as a directory of GEMS
      database extension files within the user's home directory <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P3350">(more)</a>.&nbsp;
On
      the next modeling session, the system profile record is also used for
      detecting the changes made by the user in thermodynamic database, and
      updating already created system definitions, if appropriate. This makes it
      easy to do small extensions and fixes without creating a new system
      profile and may save a lot of time and effort. Every expert in geochemical
      modeling knows that it is hardly possible to compile all the relevant
      species in advance, very often it turns to be that&nbsp; the model
      interpretation points to inclusion of a few important phases or complexes
      overlooked by everybody before. To our knowledge, no other geochemical
      modeling program permits to do it so easy and quickly as this one! </p>
    <h3> <a name="OPENPROJECT"></a>Opening the Modeling Project<tt><br>
      </tt></h3>
    So, to start modeling calculations in GEMS means to get into a system
    profile. For the beginners, one profile ("Default") is automatically created
    on the first start of GEMS. We recommend first to work with this default
    profile for some time (as described in the following sections), before
    starting to create your own system profiles.&nbsp; This profile is built on
    a major-element core part of GEMS thermodynamic database (covering 20
    elements) and can be used for solving of a wide range of "usual" geochemical
    problems in aqueous systems with gas and many simple mineral phases.
    <p>Just press the "<tt>Equilibria Calculation Mode</tt>" toolbar button on
      the GEMS3 main frame (or select the mode in "Modules" menu). A "<tt>Project
        Remake Wizard"</tt> dialog will appear, <a href="gm_project.html#PROJECT_MWIZARD">described
        in detail here</a>. After an existing project is open, or a new project
      is created,&nbsp; you can compute the equilibrium states. To create a new
      equilibrium state, the temperature, pressure and the "recipe" for bulk
      system composition and constraints must be provided (<a href="gems_bcc.html">details
        here</a>).<br>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="EQCALC"></a>Calculation of Equilibrium State</h3>
    Pressing once a big "GEM IPM" button creates an internal data structure for
    this chemical system definition and sends it to Gibbs energy minimization
    using the Interior Points Method. When calculation is finished, you can
    examine the results by pressing the "<tt>Parameters</tt>" button.
    <p>Now, let us run your first calculation by left-mouse-button-click on the
      "GEM IPM" button. A small progress dialog window with "<tt>Running IPM...</tt>"
      message and a progress bar will appear. This window shows the current
      SysEq record key and the number of iterations, total mass of gas, aqueous
      solid phases&nbsp; (in grams),&nbsp; pH, pe and ionic strength of aqueous
      electrolyte, updated every one or two seconds. A "<tt>Cancel</tt>" button
      in the lower right corner breaks the calculation. When the IPM calculation
      is converged, i.e. the equilibrium speciation is computed, the appearance
      of the progress dialog changes. It displays now "<tt>Converged at
        DK=&lt;number&gt;</tt>"&nbsp; with two buttons below - "<tt>Accept</tt>"&nbsp;
and&nbsp;
      "<tt>Discard</tt>".&nbsp; Both return back to the <tt>SysEq dialog</tt>,&nbsp;
      the difference is that&nbsp; the&nbsp; "<tt>Accept</tt>" button will
      pack&nbsp; the system definition plus IPM calculation results and save
      them to database under the current SySeq record key;&nbsp; the "<tt>Discard</tt>"
      button will not save the results.&nbsp; The SysEq record is saved also
      when pressing the&nbsp; "Save" button on the the <tt>SysEq dialog. </tt>Now,
      press "<tt>Accept" </tt>to continue. </p>
    <h4> <a name="P3230"></a><tt>3.2.3. Examination of Results (+Scroll Lists,
        Print, Calculator)</tt></h4>
    To see what we have calculated, press the "<tt>Parameters</tt>" button on<tt>
      SysEq dialog</tt>.&nbsp; An EqDemo window should appear with three
    screenforms which can be seen one at a time upon pressing the <tt>EqIcp,
      EqPhp</tt> and<tt> EqDcp </tt>buttons in the top part of the window. <tt>Close</tt>&nbsp;
button
    gets back to the&nbsp; <tt>SysEq dialog</tt>.&nbsp; Press the <tt>EqPhp</tt>&nbsp;
button&nbsp;
    to see which phases appear in just calculated equilibrium state between the
    normative&nbsp; seawater and the excess dry atmospheric air at ambient
    conditions.
    <p>On the screenform, a list of phase names now appears with several linked
      scrolllists containing some general equilibrium parameters for phases. Put
      mouse pointer on any of data fields and wait a couple of seconds - you
      will see a short (one-line) explanation about this data object right near
      the cursor. If one of the data fields is left-clicked, the same
      explanation (plus the data object label and index of the clicked cell)
      appears in the bottom line of the window.&nbsp; Press right mouse button
      to see a small pop-up menu&nbsp; - usually with "<tt>Help</tt>"&nbsp; and
      "<tt>Calculator</tt>" lines. Choosing <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P5300">"<tt>Help</tt>"</a>&nbsp;
will
      provide a HTML help page about this data object (under construction!). <a
        href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6880">Calculator</a>
      invokes a convenient calculator widget, you can fill in a cell or a range
      of cells within the data object field with certain value (e.g., zero) or
      apply any arithmetic operation to them (the second operand must be typed
      in the calculator line). The pop-up menu&nbsp; on a list of species or
      phases will contain a "<tt>Show record</tt>" instead of a "<tt>Calculator</tt>"
      line. Choosing "<tt>Show record</tt>" will display contents of the
      respective <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P33D1">ICOMP</a>,
      <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P33D3">DCOMP</a>,
      <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P33D4">REACDC</a>
      or <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P33D6">PHASE</a>
      definition records from the thermodynamic database (you can edit these
      records only in "<tt><a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P3300">Thermodynamic
          Database</a></tt>" mode). </p>
    <p>The lists of components and phases are usually large, only small part of
      them appears in the window as linked scroll lists. You can quickly scan
      the whole system by putting mouse pointer on a slider on any of the scroll
      bars and dragging it up and down.&nbsp; Within our example (<tt>EqPhp</tt>
      screenform) its possible to see that only aqueous and&nbsp; gas phases are
      present plus single-component mineral phases Fluorapatite,&nbsp; Hematite,
      and Braunite.&nbsp; Other phases from a long list of those included into
      calculation were unstable and hence zeroed off by the IPM algorithm. </p>
    <p>Now, press a <tt>EqDcp</tt> button to display the&nbsp; "Species"
      screenform.&nbsp; Basically, it is arranged in the same way as "Phase"
      screenform: on linked scroll lists, one can see the full speciation
      pattern in all phases (species go in the same order as phases, i.e. first
      all aqueous species, then gases, solid solutions and single-component
      phases).&nbsp; In addition to vector x (primary solution of the
      equilibrium calculation problem), some other useful vectors such as
      molalities and activity coefficients are displayed. Data from all these
      vectors (also in most other screenforms) can be sampled in <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P3280">GTDEMO</a>
      or used in <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P3270">PROCES</a>
      definition <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P4000">Math
        Scripts</a> by labels (with indices or names of species from the list in
      the leftmost column) visible on top of each vector.&nbsp; Scroll the lists
      down to see the speciation (all aqueous and gas species present in less
      than 10<sup>-18</sup> moles are zeroed off). </p>
    <p>Press a <tt>EqIcp</tt> button to display the "Independent Components"
      screenform.&nbsp; Here, some general information about system definition
      and properties of aqueous phase is displayed.&nbsp; The first linked
      scroll list shows the input bulk composition and the output "dual
      solution" of the IPM problem - the u vector of chemical potentials of
      independent components. Next below is another linked scroll list showing
      total concentrations of independent components dissolved in aqueous
      electrolyte. If gas phase is present in the problem formulation (not
      necessarily stable) then a third scroll list will appear below with
      partial pressures and fugacities of gases. </p>
    <h4> <a name="P3240"></a><tt>3.2.4. Modifying and Re-calculating Existing
        System Records</tt></h4>
    On the demo screenforms of EqDemo window, one can see quite realistic model
    of metastable equilibrium between the normative seawater of 35 g/kg salinity
    open to the atmosphere at P=1 bar, T=25 C.&nbsp; There are still some minor
    problems; for instance, braunite appears as a stable manganese phase&nbsp;
    and fluorapatite keeps some phosphorus and fluoride, although we know that
    these phases normally do not precipitate from seawater. So, next exercise
    will be to modify this definition of chemical system such as to exclude both
    monerals from the equilibrium state.
    <p>To do this, we have to close the <tt>EqDemo</tt> window and get back to
      the <tt>SysEq dialog</tt>. Pressing a "<tt>Thermodynamic System</tt>"
      button&nbsp; in the upper part of the dialog window will get you into
      another collection of four screen forms - a "<tt>System</tt>"
      window.&nbsp; The "<tt>Compos</tt>" screenform permits to set up bulk
      chemical composition of the system using references to <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P33D2">COMPOS</a>
      (GCO) definition records; it also contains two identification lines where
      the user can write what is this system, and optional bibliographic
      reference fields. The&nbsp; "<tt>Icomp</tt>"&nbsp; screen form permits to
      configure a list of independent components to be taken into the
      equilibrium calculation (by toggling some <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P33D1">ICOMP</a>s
      on/off&nbsp; putting pluses or minuses in the leftmost column); this
      screenform also displays the total bulk composition vector b and permits
      to add to it some quantities of independent components by typing them into
      a&nbsp; bi_&nbsp; (rightmost) vector. The "Phase" screen form lets you
      toggle some phases on/off and to set metastability parameters and specific
      surface areas, if necessary. The "<tt>Dcomp</tt>" screen form permits to
      configure the list of species to be taken into calculation of equilibria;
      the formula of any of included (toggled on) species can be used for
      incrementing the total bulk composition of the system via entering

      around with thermodynamic data, up to installing a prohibitive increment
      of +100 kJ/mole or more in order to eliminate the dependent component from

      this record key and click on the left mouse button. A g0 increment of +80
      kJ/mol already stays in this cell, and it is still insufficient to
      suppress fluorapatite - so highly oversaturated is seawater to this

    A next natural question is - how the equilibrium state may change with
    temperature and/or pressure? This is very easy to do in GEMS - it just
    requires to create a new SysEq record. Let us try the seawater-air system at
    1 <sup>o</sup>C,&nbsp; 1 bar.&nbsp; From <tt>SysEq dialog</tt>,&nbsp;
    press the "<tt>New</tt>"&nbsp; button; this will open a small "<tt>SysEq:

disassembled
    into eight edit lines.&nbsp; First line always contains the name of the
    system profile (Default); second line is always "G" - Gibbs energy is
    minimized (minimization of other thermodynamic potentials is under
    construction);&nbsp; third line is an identifier of chemical system
    ("Seawater); fourth line is variant number of system composition definition
    (0, can be any integer up to 9999); fifth line is total volume constraint of
    the system (0 means no constraint); sixth line is pressure (1 bar); seventh
    line is temperature (25 <sup>o</sup>C); and eigth line is number of variant

      need to re-structurize the system - just to recalculate thermodynamic data
      to different temperature (right now done autonmatically).&nbsp; A
      "System::"&nbsp; window now appears. You can edit the first identification
      line by adding&nbsp; "... at 1 bar 1 C" or something like that and press
      the "<tt>Close</tt>" button to come back to&nbsp; <tt>SysEq dialog. </tt>The
      list of new values of thermodynamic data for all species in the system
      profile can be checked by pressing the "<tt>T,P &amp; Thermodynamic Data"
      </tt>button in the lower left corner; the numbers will remain the same
      until different temperature or pressure is specified by picking up an
      existing&nbsp; SysEq&nbsp; record or creating a new record, just as we did
      before. Now, press the big "<tt>GEM IPM</tt>" button to calculate the new
      equilibrium state. Press "<tt>Accept</tt>" to save the results when
      calculation is finished. Examine the results by pressing "<tt>Parameters</tt>"
      button, as described <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P3230">above</a>
      . Now you can see what has changed compared to 25 <sup>o</sup>C; for
      instance, concentrations of dissolved gases such as O2@&nbsp; increased;
      the total dissolved carbon is now&nbsp; 2.3169 millimolal against 2.1032
      at 25 <sup>o</sup>C; pH is somewhat lower, quartz appears as stable
      phase, hausmannite disappears and so on. </p>
    <p>In quite a similar way, by "cloning" already created SysEq records, the
      impact of changed bulk composition onto chemical equilibrium states can be
      investigated, either at fixed or variable T,P. Please, try it! First,
      select again the&nbsp; "<tt>Default:G:Seawater:0:0:1:25:0:</tt>" by
      pressing <tt>"Select</tt>" button on SysEq dialog window and pointing to
      the record key in the list. Then press the "New" button, modify the record
      key to "<tt>Default:G:Seawater:1:0:1:1:0:" </tt>and press<tt> OK, </tt>then<tt>
        "Bypass". </tt>A "System::"&nbsp; window now appears. You can edit the
      first identification line changing it to " Seawater at 1 bar 1 C closed at
      1 bar 25 C". Then change the bulk composition of the system by removing
      practically all the atmospheric air. To do this, find "AtmAirSim" name in
      the list of Compos record keys, and, against this name to the right,
      change the <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6104">units
of
        measurement</a> from "M" (moles) to "g" (grams) in&nbsp; the XAun_
      column, and 10 to 0.1 in the xa_ column. This actually means that we
      removed 9.9999 kg of air from the bulk composition of the system and thus
      made 1 kg of seawater nearly "closed" with respect to the atmosphere.
      Please, note that you can also enter <i>negative</i> quantities into xa_,
      xd_, and&nbsp; bi_&nbsp; vectors; the program checks only that the numbers
      in the b_ vector are non-negative and will issue a warning if you have
      made a mistake. All right, after you have changed the composition, press "<tt>Close</tt>"
      button and then the "<tt>GEM IPM</tt>" button to calculate the new
      equilibrium state. Press "<tt>Accept</tt>" to save the results. Examine
      the results by pressing "<tt>Parameters</tt>" button, as described <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P3230">above</a>
      . Now you can see what has changed compared to the open seawater at 25 <sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp;
For
      instance, we have calculated a terrific pH = 8.5, f(CO<sub>2</sub>) = 13.2
      Pa and f(O<sub>2</sub>) = 0.08 bar (normal values are pH about 8.2, f(CO<sub>2</sub>)
      = 35 Pa and f(O<sub>2</sub>)=0.21 bar). This is just a consequence of
      "cooling down" a closed parcel of normative seawater equilibrated to the
      atmosphere at 25 <sup>o</sup>C. Now, you are prepared to an infinite play
      with the seawater model - for instance, you can create a next system
      immediately, by adding 1 millimole of carbon or "Redfield organic matter"
      Compos (CorgRedf) to see a profound difference in speciation and partial
      pressures of gases in reduced seawater. This. however, goes far beyond the
      scope of this manual. You should have now a feeling that it is really easy
      to check various geochemical ideas while performing calculations with
      GEMS! </p>
    <h4> <a name="P3260"></a><tt>3.2.6. Sequential Reactor Models</tt></h4>
    Sequential reactors modeling is often used to reproduce changes in stable
    mineral assemblage and equilibrated (mobile) aqueous or gas phases in
    irreversible processes like infiltration metasomatosis, weathering,
    evaporation, or evolution of aqueous fluid and wall-rock minerals in
    convective hydrothermal systems (Karpov, 1981; Borisov and Shvarov,1992).
    The idea is to divide a big "megasystem" into several local-equilibrium
    "reactors". Aqueous solution of some initial bulk composition enters (in
    some predefined quantity <tt>qAqu</tt>) into the first reactor containing
    also the bulk composition of some rock in quantity <tt>qRock</tt>. Then the
    fluid reaches equilibrium with the rock, possibly dissolving some minerals
    and precipitating others. Afterwards, certain quantities of phases (e.g.,
    aqueous fluid) are displaced to the next reactor, with the same or different
    rock composition, or with another fluid composition to mix and equilibrate,
    possibly at different temperature and pressure. The process is repeated
    until all the desired sequence of irreversible changes is modelled.
    <p>To run such a model in GEMS, one first has to create and calculate a
      start SysEq record, e.g., representing&nbsp; equilibrium in the initial
      fluid only. Next, perform the following algorithm. </p>

        flags.</li>
      <li> Look at help line for every switch doing a mouse click on it. Find a
        switch "<tt>xp_&nbsp; via quantities of phases ...</tt>" and check it on
        (with asterisk *), then press<tt> OK </tt>to proceed. This switch
        activates the mode of using bulk compositions of phases from a
        previously calculated equilibrium state to calculate bulk composition of
        the new system.</li>
      <li> On appearing database file selection dialog, entitled "mark one SysEq
        record for getting phase bulk compositions", select key of the initial
        (or previous) SysEq record. This record key should then appear in&nbsp;
        "SyPhEQ" line on&nbsp; <tt>System::Compos</tt>&nbsp; screen form.</li>
      <li> Switch to the <tt>System::Compos</tt> screen form and find a new
        xp_&nbsp; vector column (with all zeros in grams by default). Specify
        quantity (and units) of aqueous (gas or other) phase from previous SysEq
        record that you wish to be moved into your new "reactor" in xp_ column.</li>
      <li> Check that only remaining part of the system bulk composition has
        been specified in other vectors like xa_,&nbsp; xd_, and bi_ (usually
        quantities of water and air given there must be zeroed off).</li>
      <li> Proceed with <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P3220">calculation
of
          equilibrium state</a> as usual and save it to database. If a "Warning:
        Charge imbalance in calculated bulk composition! Zero it off?" message
        appears, press "Yes" button.</li>
      <li> If more "reactors" have to be calculated, repeat this algorithm
        selecting just-calculated SysEq as previous "SyPhEQ" record. Otherwise,
        sequential reactor model is finished.</li>
    </ol>
    &nbsp;In this simple way, very sophisticated irreversible processes can be
    simulated using GEMS. Automatic calculation of sequential reactors using <a
      href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P3270">PROCES</a>
    simulators is also possible (for experienced users). Sampling and plotting
    of the results with <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P3280">GTDEMO</a>
    is strongly recommended. <br>
    &nbsp;
    <h4> <a name="P3270"></a><tt>3.2.7. Setting up and Running Process
        Definitions</tt></h4>
    Most geochemical modeling problems require calculation of a series of
    equilibrium states to simulate processes such as mixing, dissolution,
    titration etc. Doing this in manual mode can be boring and time-consuming,
    especially when the process is controlled by a certain regular change of
    bulk composition of the system. To facilitate this, a Process simulator
    record type has been implemented in GEMS code .In calculation mode, this
    simulator generates a sequence of SysEq records which are then calculated
    and stored, to be sampled finally into one or several Gtdemo records.
    <p>Two types of process simulations are possible. The "S" (sequential) type
      implies that the next step of the process does not depend on the
      calculated parameters of equilibrium from the previous step. This is true
      for temperature-pressure changes, simple titrations, and simple reaction
      extent models like dissolution of a fixed rock composition. The "U"
      (reciprocal) type of the process means that the next step depends on some
      parameters of the current equilibrium state, for example, on pH, pe, bulk
      composition of equilibrium phases, activity of some species etc. Typical
      examples are sequential reactors; inverse titrations (to given values of
      pH or pe); or kinetically dependent processes. In case of inverse
      titration modeling, certain amount of titrant (acid, base, oxidant or
      reductant) should be found which brings the aquatic system to certain,
      pre-defined value of equilibrium pH (or pe, or both). To do this, a "gold
      section" optimization procedure is invoked which compares the calculated
      value to the prescribed one, and makes a correction to the amount of
      titrant, until a convergence with necessary precision is achieved. </p>
    <p>In general, it may be difficult to predict all meaningful process
      formulations which may be of interest to (geo)chemists because a process
      formulation depends on the system definition and modeling objectives, and
      an unlimited variety of these&nbsp; is possible. Therefore, in GEMS code,
      the simulated irreversible processes are usually defined using the <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P4000">Math
        Scripts</a> where the user can write&nbsp; what exactly and where should
      be changed in the SysEq record for the next step of the simulated
      sequence. This provides you with an unmatched freedom and flexibility
      because nearly all numeric input and output data objects in GEMS are
      accessible to Math Scripts via their labels and indices.&nbsp; The Math
      Script text is translated into the internal code at the beginning of
      process simulation, then run automatically in a stack-based interpreter at
      each simulation step. Some examples of PROCES math scripts are provided <a
        href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P4600">below</a>.
    </p>
    <p>A Process definition record always refers to an (ordinary) SysEq record
      which must exist in the database before the process definition is created
      and executed. This "parent" SysEq record is used as a template which is
      modified and "cloned" into a sequence of SysEq record generated by the
      process simulator. For this reason, the first eight&nbsp; fields of the
      PROCES record key are the same as in its parent <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P3251">SysEq
record
        key</a>, followed by the process identifier and type fields.&nbsp; The
      parent SysEq record is never changed by the process simulator; it is just
      used as a template to generate new, modified SysEq records on the
      simulation steps. </p>

        Simulation of Irreversible Processes</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> Many geochemical modeling
        problems require calculation of a series of equilibrium states to

        computed in one such "process simulation".&nbsp; <br>

    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> Doing this by creating single

        calculating and examining equilibria <a href="file:///Users/kulik/Developer/upgrade/GEMS-GUI/Resources/doc/html/gemstart.html#GSM_SINGLE_EQSTAT">as
described
          previously</a>, would be a rather time-consuming, inefficient and
        boring job, especially when the process simulation is to be controlled
        by a certain regular change of temperature, pressure, or bulk
        composition of the system. Process Simulators of the GEM-Selektor
        (implemented in the <a href="file:///Users/dimacool/Developer/trunk/gems3/shared/doc/html/gm_proces.html">Process</a>
        module and record type) can greatly facilitate and accelerate this work
        - from telling the program what to change in the CSD from one
        equilibrium point to another, up to sampling, plotting and exporting
        relevant results.<br>
      </font> </p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">In this section, we will create
        some Process Simulators within the "Carbonat" modelling project. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Firstly, we will plot the
        aqueous speciation of calcium as it depends on the CO<sub>2</sub>
        &nbsp;addition in the closed system in presence of Portlandite Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>
        and Calcite CaCO<sub>3</sub> solid phases. This can be done in a "direct
        titration" process, also convenient for plotting redox changes upon
        addition of a reductant (or oxidant) to the closed system (shown on an
        example of adding carbon to the aqueous solution with Fe-Mn oxides). <br>
      </font> </p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Secondly, we will plot the
        aqueous speciation as function of pH in presence of calcite in the open
        system. As pH cannot be set directly as an input parameter of the GEM
        algorithm, we will have to adjust pH by adding acid (HCl) or base
        (NaOH). The best way to obtain nice graphs is to perform a series of the
        so-called "inverse titrations" (where the program itself looks for an
        addition of acid or base for obtaining a prescribed value of calculated
        pH). Later on, the sequence of inverse titration points can easily be
        converted into a (much faster) direct titration simulation. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Finally, we will learn how to
        set up and run the Process Simulator in a "sequential reactor"
        mode.&nbsp;</font></p>

        you first have to create its "parent" <a href="file:///Users/kulik/Developer/upgrade/GEMS-GUI/Resources/doc/html/gm_syseq.html">SysEq

        &nbsp; <br>

        time, you should get 0.1565 moles of the gas phase, pH = 6.0 and
        fugacity of CO<sub>2</sub> close to 1. So, the titration can be stopped
        at about 0.3 moles of added CO<sub>2</sub>. You can delete the trial

        The first iterator <a href="file:///Users/kulik/Developer/upgrade/GEMS-GUI/Resources/doc/html/gm_proces.html#iTm_0"><big><tt>iTm</tt></big></a>
        defines how the program will number the generated system definitions
        (CSD). If we start with CSD #1000 and will produce 31 points, then we
        will end up with a CSD #1300 at increment 10. &nbsp;So, we should set
        &nbsp;<big><tt>iTm</tt></big> &nbsp;to these values 1000, 1300 and 10
        (from top to bottom). <br>
        <br>
        Pressure (1 bar) and temperature (25 C) will be kept constant, so there
        is nothing to change in the <a href="file:///Users/kulik/Developer/upgrade/GEMS-GUI/Resources/doc/html/gm_proces.html#iP_0"><big><tt>iP</tt></big></a>
        and <a href="file:///Users/kulik/Developer/upgrade/GEMS-GUI/Resources/doc/html/gm_proces.html#iTC_0"><big><tt>iTC</tt></big></a>
        iterators. The <a href="file:///Users/kulik/Developer/upgrade/GEMS-GUI/Resources/doc/html/gm_proces.html#iNv_0"><big><tt>iNv</tt></big></a>
        iterator should usually be set the same as the last field of the
        "parent" SysEq record key, i.e. left as 1, 1, 0 in this case. <br>
        <br>
        The<b> </b><a href="file:///Users/kulik/Developer/upgrade/GEMS-GUI/Resources/doc/html/gm_proces.html#iNu_0"><big><tt>iNu</tt></big></a>
        iterator should usually contain the range ( 0 to 0.3 mol) and the linear
        increment (0.01 mol) for additions the titrant, in our case, CO<sub>2</sub>
        to bulk composition of the parent system. &nbsp;So, set <big><tt>iNu</tt></big>
        to 0, 0.3 and 0.01. <br>
        <br>
        After you have set the iterators, what remains is to write up the
        process simulation and the data sampling <a href="file:///Users/kulik/Developer/upgrade/GEMS-GUI/Resources/doc/html/gmscript.html">math

        Writing Process Simulation Math Script&nbsp;</font></h3>
    <p><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> A&nbsp;large
        (still empty) field at the bottom of "Page 1" of the "Process" window
        should contain a math script that tells the program what and how to
        change during the process simulation. To facilitate writing of such
        scripts, the GEMS code is provided with the <a href="file:///Users/kulik/Developer/upgrade/GEMS-GUI/Resources/doc/html/gm_sdref.html">"Template
          script library"</a>, accessible via the "Help" "Scripts..." menu
        command or the <big><tt>F3</tt></big> keystroke. <br>
      </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">In the case of
        present example, the simulation script must change step-by-step the
        addition of CO<sub>2</sub> to bulk composition of the "parent" system.
        The easiest way to do it is to use <a href="file:///Users/kulik/Developer/upgrade/GEMS-GUI/Resources/doc/html/gm_proces.html#cNu"><big><tt>cNu</tt></big></a>
        - a work cell connected to the <big><tt>iNu</tt></big> process
        iterator. When the process simulator runs, it first sets <big><tt>cNu</tt></big>
        equal to <big><tt>iNu[0]</tt></big> and then automatically increments
        the <big><tt>cNu</tt></big> cell by&nbsp; <big><tt>iNu[2]</tt></big></span><span
        style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> value until it becomes
        greater than</span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><big><tt>
            iNu[1]</tt></big>, or the maximum total number of steps (31 in this
        case) is reached. So, for now, the following simple script will do the
        requested job: <br>
      </span></p>
    <blockquote><big><tt>$ Check if not zero</tt></big><br>
      <big><tt>cNu =: ( cNu? cNu: 1e-6 );</tt></big><br>

    <p><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small>Lines beggining
            with "$" are comments. The first operator checks if cNu contains
            zero (the first simulation point in our case) and, if so, replaces

            carbon and its species from the CSD. The second operator stores
            additions of CO<sub>2</sub> in J-th simulation point for the

    <h4> <a name="P3280"></a><tt>3.2.8. Setting up and Running Graphic-Demo
        Data Samplers</tt></h4>
    When many equilibrium states are calculated using the Process definition to
    simulate titrations, process extent models, evaporation or temperature/
    pressure changes, it is problematic to print out all the results, pick up
    and plot them by hand. To facilitate this operation - a crucial step in the
    performance of&nbsp; modeling results interpretation - a special facility is
    included into GEMS code.&nbsp; This is a Gtdemo data sampler and plotter
    which works according to specifications provided in the Gtdemo records
    stored in&nbsp; the users database extension files.&nbsp; Gtdemo can sample
    virtually any numerical data by reading records of any type according to a
    selected sequence of record keys. Which data to extract and how to
    recalculate them - the user can specify in a <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P4000">Math
      Script</a> text in a special Gtdemo record field.&nbsp; As in case of the
    <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P3270">Process
      simulator</a>, the Gtdemo math script is automatically translated and run
    every time when the Gtdemo record is recalculated. When a next data record
    is extracted from the database, the Math Script is run to pick up the
    necessary data, re-scale them or calculate some derived parameters, and
    store into a Gtdemo table (up to 10 columns). When scanning of database
    records is finished, this table can also be displayed on a screen form, <a
      href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P333R9">printed</a>
    into a text file for subsequent import to worksheets or sophisticated
    scientific graphing software for high-quality presentations, or <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P333R8">plotted</a>
    in a graphic window. Graphs can be <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P3290">customized</a>,
    zoomed and printed. A sequence of (user-defined) experimental points can be
    displayed on the graph together with the sampled (or calculated) numbers -
    this is very useful when the thermodynamic model has to be fitted to the
    experimental data. Any number of Gtdemo records can be created for sampling
    the same set of GEMS database records.
    <h5> <a name="P3281"></a>3.2.8.1. Creating or Modifying Gtdemo Records</h5>
    To create/modify a Gtdemo record, press a "Data Sampler and Graph Demo"
    button in "Calculation of Equilibria" dialog. In the "GtDemo" window, select
    <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P333R3">"Record"
      "Create"</a> or <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P333R2">"Record"
      "Remake"</a> menu commands and then type in or select a Gtdemo record key
    of the following format: <br>
    &nbsp;
    <table border="3" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Profile_id</td>
          <td>Top_chain</td>
          <td>GD_code</td>
          <td>Variant_#</td>
          <td>GD_name</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>str_10</td>
          <td>str_8</td>
          <td>str_4</td>
          <td>int_4</td>
          <td>str_16</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Top_chain field shows the highest-level record type to be sampled (e.g.,
      PROCES which implies that SysEq records created by the Process Simulator
      will be sampled together with the data in IPM work structure (Multi) and
      thermodynamic data from the Profile structure). GD_code is usually "GT".
      Variant_# should be different if another Gtdemo sampler is created for the
      same output dataset. When a new Gtdemo record key is assembled, press OK
      to proceed. Select the top record chain to be sampled from the appearing
      list and press OK (if Proces is selected, you will have to select one
      Proces record after that). Now, in "Reorganization of Data Fields" dialog,
      press "<tt>Clear all</tt>" button if you wish to create the Gtdemo sampler
      from scratch, "<tt>Remake</tt>" for changing some fields with
      re-configuration of the record, or "<tt>Bypass</tt>" if you will only edit
      some names or math script lines.&nbsp; In the first two cases, a&nbsp;
      "GtDemo: Remake Parameters" window appears with switches and counters.
      Read meaning of the switches and counters by pointing mouse to them, and
      modify wherever necessary. The most important input at this step is a
      gDimXY[1] field where you should type a number of columns for the Gtdemo
      table to be produced. Do not enter anything into gDimXY[0] cell (number of
      lines in Gtdemo sampler table) as it will be automatically set later upon
      selection of records to be sampled. If you wish also to plot experimental
      data on the graph for comparison with calculated results then turn on the
      first switch ("Use empirical data") and enter number of lines to gDimEf[0]
      and columns(ordinates) to gDimEf[1] cells for allocating object fields
      where you can type in the experimental data later. Press<tt> OK </tt>when
      configuration is finished. You will be asked to set template for the
      database record list (just press OK for the first time). The list of
      record keys will appear, select needed ones by lef-mouse-clicks and press
      OK. </p>
    <p>Now, <tt>Page 1 </tt>of the<tt> GtDemo::</tt> window appears. Fill out
      the "GDname" and "GDcom" lines and also type in the names for abscissa and
      ordinate (for the plot legend), as well as the column (line) identifiers
      in "gLnam" fields. If you have ordered arrays for experimental data, fill
      in the identifier(s) in&nbsp; "gLnamE" fields, go to<tt> Page 3 </tt>of<tt>
        GtDemo </tt>window and type the data into "xE" vector (abscissa) and
      "yE" columns (ordinates). Now, what remains is to write a Math Script
      which will pick the numbers from GEMS data objects and put them into "x0"
      vector (abscissa) and "y0" columns (ordinates) of the Gtdemo sampler
      table. </p>
    <h5> <a name="P3282"></a>3.2.8.2. Modifying Math-Scripts&nbsp; in Gtdemo
      Samplers</h5>
    On<tt> Page 2 </tt>of<tt> GtDemo </tt>window, you can see two special
    Gtdemo data objects: <tt>"next"</tt>&nbsp; contains 1 if the next data
    record is to be sampled, or 0 if the sequence is finished; and "<tt>jR</tt>"
    - index of the (currently processed) data record from the "GD_rkl" list.
    These two objects together with&nbsp; the "x0", "y0" arrays can be used as
    variables in the Gtdemo <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P4000">Math
Script
      expressions</a> aimed at describing which data to sample and assign to
    x0[jR]&nbsp; and y0[jR][0], y0[jR][1], .... cells (the jR index is
    incremented automatically when Gtdemo sampler is calculated). The script can
    be typed into <tt>"gExpr"</tt> text field on <tt>Page 1</tt> of "<tt>GtDemo::</tt>"&nbsp;
    window.&nbsp; The typical Gtdemo script looks like this:
    <p><tt>$ Abscissa - Ca/Si bulk ratio in the system</tt> <br>
      <tt>x0[jR] =: b[\i{Ca}] / b{Si};</tt> <br>
      <tt>$ Ordinates - total dissolved Ca and Si, millimolal</tt> <br>
      <tt>y0[jR][0] =: m_t{Ca} * 1000;</tt> <br>
      <tt>y0[jR][1] =: m_t{Si} * 1000;</tt> <br>
      <tt>$ Free Ca+2 ion, millimolal</tt> <br>
      <tt>y0[jR][2] =: my[\j{Ca}] * 1000;</tt> <br>
      <tt>$ end</tt> </p>
    <p>This little program is run automatically to pick up data from&nbsp; SysEq
      records (indexed <tt>jR</tt>) read one-by-one&nbsp; by the Gtdemo
      sampler. Comment lines begin from "$" and explain what is done by the
      following math script operators.&nbsp; There are many ways to specify
      various data samplers using Math Script expressions; some examples are
      provided <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P4600">below</a>.
    </p>
    <h5> <a name="P3283"></a>3.2.8.3. Running Gtdemo Samplers</h5>
    After editing of the Gtdemo definition fields is finished, press <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P333R4">"Calculate"</a>
    button or menu command to start calculations. If the Math script contains
    syntax errors, you may be asked to fix them before the program can proceed.
    Calculations may take time, especially if many large SysEq records are
    sampled because each such record is expanded into both Multi and System
    Definition data structures and thermodynamic data are calculated if
    temeprature or pressure differs (depending on the processor performance).
    When all database records are sampled, you will see "GtDemo calculation
    finished OK" in the status line of the "GtDemo::" window. Press "<tt>Page 3</tt>"&nbsp;
    button and proceed with analyzing, plotting and printing&nbsp; the results.
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <h4> <a name="P3290"></a><tt>3.2.9. Plotting Data and Customizing Graphs</tt></h4>
    To plot Gtdemo arrays, select a "Record" "Plot" menu command of "GtDemo::"
    window. You will be prompted to save Gtdemo record to database (it is wise
    to do it). A graph window entitled as the "GDname" line appears. You can see
    what each line means after pressing on the "Legend" button. "Fragment"
    button will display an enlarged fragment of the graph. "Print" button
    function is still under construction.
    <p>To customise the graph, press the "Legend" button to open "Legend"
      dialog. On this simple form, you can set up scales for abscissa and
      ordinates, select axis type (the number of grid lines), define size and
      position of zoomed fragment, and set symbol shape, size and color, as well
      as line thickness and color, for each ordinate. The "Background" button
      lets you to specify background color for the graph (not saved in this
      version!). </p>
    <p>If you have entered some experimental data into xE and yE arrays, their
      symbols and colors can be customized separately on the "Legend" dialog. We
      recommend to use a <tt>ksnapshot</tt> utility program (a KDE application)
      for capturing Gtdemo graphs and legends into <tt>*.png</tt> files. <br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h4> 3.2.3 Setting up a GtDemo data sampler</h4>
    <p><br>
      When many equilibrium states are calculated using the Process definition
      to simulate titrations, reaction progress models, evaporation or
      temperature/ pressure changes, it is impractical to print out all the
      results, pick up and plot them by hand. To facilitate this crucial step in
      the interpretation of modeling results, a special facility is included
      into GEM-Selektor code.&nbsp; The facility is called a "GtDemo data
      sampler" module, which collects the numerical data by reading records
      according to a pre-defined sequence of record keys from the GEMS database.
      <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>Data to extract and to recalculate can be specified in a <a href="file:///C:/GEMS2test/program/doc/html/gmscript.html">math
        script</a> text inside GtDemo definition.&nbsp; As in the case of <a href="file:///C:/GEMS2test/program/doc/html/gm_proces.html">Process
        simulator</a>, the GtDemo math script is automatically translated and
      run every time when the GtDemo module reads a record from the database. As
      a rule, the math script stores any sampled and (optionally) re-calculated
      data into GtDemo abscissa vector <tt>x0</tt> and table (matrix) object <tt>y0</tt>
      (up to 20 columns). These data objects are displayed on a "GtDemo" window
      page; can be printed into a text file for subsequent export to worksheets
      or&nbsp; high-quality presentation software; or plotted directly in a
      Graph Dialog window. <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>Graphs can be customized, zoomed and printed. A sequence of
      (user-defined) empirical data points can be kept in the GtDemo record
      (optional <tt>xE</tt> and <tt>yE</tt> arrays), shown&nbsp; on the graph
      together with the sampled (calculated) data, which is very convenient for
      fitting thermodynamic model parameters to experimental data. Any number of
      GtDemo records can be created for sampling different information from the
      same set of GEM-Selektor database records. <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>To create a <a href="file:///C:/GEMS2test/program/doc/html/gm_gtdemo.html">GtDemo
        data sampler</a>, press the <tt>"Data Sampling and Plotting (GtDemo)"</tt>
      button in the "Computation of Geochemical Equilibrium Models" dialog. In
      the&nbsp; (empty) "GtDemo" window, as usual, select <tt>"Record" "Create"</tt>
      menu commands. A small "GtDemo: Please, enter a new key" will appear with
      five edit lines according to the <a href="file:///C:/GEMS2test/program/doc/html/gdb_rkey.html#dbm_GtDemo">GtDemo
record
        format</a>. <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>The first field already contains profile name (<tt>Default</tt>). The
      second field shows what record type (database module) will be sampled,
      type <tt>"SysEq"</tt> here. The third field codes thew type of GtDemo
      sampler, enter <tt>"GT"</tt> for now. The fourth field contains an
      identification number, type 0 there (many GtDemo records can be created
      for the same list of sampled records). The fifth field is the name of
      GtDemo sampler (up to 16 characters), type <tt>"CaSrCO3SS_aq". </tt>Press
      <tt>"Ok"</tt> when ready. You will see a list of database record types;
      click on "SysEq" to select it, and press <tt>"Ok"</tt> to proceed. This
      will show the familiar "Reorganization of Data Fields" dialog; to create
      the first record, press <tt>"Clear all"</tt> button. <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>In the appearing "GtDemo: Remake parameters" dialog, first type in <tt>GDname</tt>
      and <tt>GDcom</tt> fields as follows: <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p><tt>Solubility of Ca and Sr at equilibrium with (Ca,Sr)CO3 SS</tt> <br>
      <tt>as function of bulk solid X(Sr) at S/W = 20 g/L</tt> <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>The idea is to plot total dissolved calcium and strontium (molal) as
      function of total mole fraction of Sr in solid phases (i.e. in binary
      system). As experimental data in [<a href="file:///C:/GEMS2test/program/doc/html/g_litref.html#%5B1987PLU/BUS%5D">1987PLU/BUS</a>]
      does not discriminate between Ca and Sr, we will also plot a Ca+Sr line
      and will compare it with some experimental points. So, in total we have 3
      plots and need 3 columns in the <tt>y0</tt> table and, say, 7
      experimental points and 1 column in the <tt>yE</tt> table. To set this
      up, find the <tt>gDimXY[0,1]</tt> cell and enter 3 there, then enter 7
      and 1 into <tt>gDimEf[0,0]</tt> and <tt>gDimEf[0,1]</tt>, respectively,
      and turn on (<tt>'+'</tt>) the <tt>GDps[0,0]</tt> flag. Press <tt>"Ok"</tt>
      when finished. <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>A small "Set template" dialog will appear, just press <tt>"Ok"</tt> for
      now. You will see a list of SysEq record keys with a title " Marking
      record keys for data extraction". With left mouse clicks, select all <tt>CaSrCO3SS</tt>&nbsp;
      record keys numbered from <tt>1000</tt> to <tt>1200</tt> (as they were
      set up in the Process definition). Selected lines in the list are
      indicated by dark background color. Press <tt>"Ok"</tt> when ready. You
      will see the "GtDemo" window (<tt>Page 1</tt>) with empty single- and
      multi-line editor fields. The largest one is called <tt>gExpr</tt>, it
      must contain a <tt>GtDemo</tt> <a href="file:///C:/GEMS2test/program/doc/html/gmscript.html">math
        script</a>, written, in principle, in a similar way as that in the <a href="file:///C:/GEMS2test/program/doc/html/gm_proces.html">Process
        simulator</a> definition. <tt>gX_Nam</tt> and <tt>gY_Nam</tt> fields
      may contain names of abscissa and ordinate axis, respectively (in our case
      <tt>"X_Sr"</tt>&nbsp; and <tt>"log_m"</tt>). The <tt>gLnam</tt> list
      contains identifiers for the plot lines (columns in the <tt>y0</tt>
      array), in case of our example, enter <tt>"Ca_aq", "Sr_aq"</tt> and <tt>"Ca+Sr"</tt>;
      likewise, the <tt>gLnamE</tt> object identifies (plots of) the empirical
      data that the user has entered into columns of the optional <tt>yE</tt>
      array (<tt>"Ca+Sr_E"</tt>). <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>Now, it's time to write the math script; in GtDemo definition, it must
      contain assignments such as <tt>x0[jR] =: ...... ;&nbsp; y0[jR][0] =:
        ....; y0[jR][1] =: ...;&nbsp; ......</tt>&nbsp; Such operators will put
      sampled data into lines of the <tt>x0</tt> and <tt>y0</tt> arrays. In
      most cases, it is sufficient to describe only how one record should be
      sampled using the <tt>jR</tt> index variable which is automatically
      changed from 0 to <tt>gDimXY[0,0] </tt>(total number of sampled records)
      upon GtDemo module execution. On the right side of assignment operators,
      you can use any (indexed) <a href="file:///C:/GEMS2test/program/doc/html/g_useref.html">data
        object labels</a> which refer to meaningful numerical data existing at
      present in GEM-Selektor program memory. These labels are seen on any
      module page screen forms (e.g., "EqDemo") or window status lines. <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>For our example (Ca-Sr carbonate SSAS system), the following script will
      do the job: <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <blockquote><tt>$ Determine Sr mole fraction in solid</tt> <br>
      <tt>x0[jR] =: ( b[\i{Sr}] - bXa[0][{Sr}] ) /</tt> <br>
      <tt>&nbsp; ( b[{Sr}] - bXa[0][{Sr}] + b[{Ca}] - bXa[0][{Ca}] );</tt> <br>
      <tt>$ Collect total dissolved Ca and Sr in log molal</tt> <br>
      <tt>y0[jR][0] =: lgm_t[{Ca}];</tt> <br>
      <tt>y0[jR][1] =: lgm_t[{Sr}];</tt> <br>
      <tt>$ Calculate log of sum of dissolved Ca and Sr</tt> <br>
      <tt>y0[jR][2] =: lg( 10^lgm_t[{Ca}] + 10^lgm_t[{Sr}] );</tt> <br>
      <tt>$ End</tt></blockquote>
    <p><br>
      You can see the contents of data objects&nbsp; <tt>b&nbsp;</tt> and&nbsp;
      <tt>lgm_t</tt> in the "EqDemo" window, page <tt>EqIC</tt> and the
      bXa&nbsp; data object - in the "Multi" window, page <tt>Phas D</tt>. Both
      are accessible from the "Single Thermodynamic System" dialog, buttons <tt>"Dual
        solution..."</tt> and <tt>"Details for experts"</tt>, respectively.
      Every time when a new SysEq record is loaded by the GtDemo module, the
      script will be executed, the <tt>jR</tt> index automatically incremented,
      and the next record loaded from the database. Enter the script (or copy it
      using clipboard) into <tt>gExpr</tt> editor field on <tt>Page 1</tt> of
      the "GtDemo" window and press the <tt>"Calculate"</tt> icon or <tt>"Record"
        "Calculate"</tt> menu commands (save the GtDemo record to database upon
      warning). <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>If there were no syntax errors in the math script, the program will
      silently spend some seconds for loading SysEq records one-by-one and
      calculating the data. Finally, the "GtDemo" window title will show a
      message "Calculation finished OK". Now, we can examine and plot the
      results; to do it, select <tt>Page 2</tt> of rhe "GtDemo" window. There
      you will see <tt>x0</tt> and <tt>y0</tt> arrays filled with sampled
      numbers, as well as <tt>xE </tt>and <tt>yE</tt> columns still
      containing zeros. From the <tt>"Record"</tt> menu, the <tt>"Print"</tt>
      item exports data to ASCII print files, and the <tt>"Plot"</tt> item
      opens the Graph Dialog window where <tt>y0</tt> and <tt>yE</tt> columns
      are plotted as lines (or scattered symbols, or both) against the <tt>x0
        (xE)</tt> abscissa. <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>Select the <tt>"Record" "Plot"</tt> menu commands. You will be prompted
      to save the GtDemo record to database (it is always wise to do it).&nbsp;
      A graph window entitled as the "GDname" line appears. You can see what
      each line means in the "Legend" on the right side. A The <tt>"Fragment" </tt>button
      will display an enlarged fragment of the graph. A <tt>"Print..."</tt>
      button sends the plot window contents to standard printing device (in this
      version, may still be under construction). Line thickness, color and
      symbols can be customized in the Legend Dialog which appears on pressing
      the <tt>"Customize..."</tt> button on the graph. There you can set up
      scales for abscissa and ordinates, select axis type (the number of grid
      lines), define size and position of zoomed fragment, and set symbol shape,
      size and color, as well as line thickness and color, for each ordinate.
      The <tt>"Background"</tt> button lets you specify a background color for

    <p>If you have entered some experimental data into <tt>xE</tt> and <tt>yE</tt>
      arrays, their symbols and colors can be customized separately on the

    <h4> <a name="3_2_5_export_results"></a>3.2.5 Exporting sampled results</h4>
    <p><br>
      To export data sampled by a GtDemo definition, open the "GtDemo" window,
      load a record of interest, and select <tt>"Record" "Print"</tt> commands
      from the menu. You will have to answer questions such as which format
      (tabular or plain text) to use, and whether to print math script together
      with the data. Then a standard "File selection" dialog appears where you
      can enter the file name and choose the directory path to save the file.
      This ASCII file can then be edited using any standard text editor and
      imported into Microsoft(R) Excel or other commercial presentation
      programs. We are going to provide output filters for exporting data into
      some important formats in the future versions of GEM-Selektor. <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>Let us return to our numerical example - (Ca,Sr)CO<sub>3</sub> SSAS
      system, - and examine the plot of aqueous solubility data in more details.
      Please, open the "GtDemo" window, load the previously created record keyed
      "<tt>Default:SysEq:GT:0:CaSrCO3SS_aq:"</tt>, and plot it (<tt>"Record"
        "Plot"</tt> menu commands). We see on the plot that Sr_aq steeply
      increases from less than 1e-7 to about 1e-3 molal at 1e-6 &lt; <i>X</i>
      (Sr) &lt; 0.005 and then Sr_aq and Ca_aq remain constant along the
      miscibility gap where compositions of both solid solution phases are fixed
      at the spinodal mole fractions up to <i>X</i> (Sr) = 0.86. At higher mole
      fractions of Sr in the solid, Sr_aq increases up to the solubility of pure
      strontianite (4.5 mmolal) while Ca_aq goes below 1e-6 molal. <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>Let us see how the calculated total dissolved Ca+Sr fit with the
      experimental data of Plummer and Busenberg [<a href="file:///C:/GEMS2test/program/doc/html/g_litref.html#%5B1987PLU/BUS%5D">1987PLU/BUS</a>].
To

      of the "GtDemo" window only seven points from their Table 4 for 25 <sup>o</sup>C

    <p>When ready, save the record to database and plot the data again (<tt>"Record"
        "Plot"</tt>). Customize the graph (make scattered symbols of size 5,
      line type 0 for the experimental points). The experimentally determined
      total solubilities are significantly less than our model predictions at
      total 0.6 &lt; <i>X</i> (Sr) &lt; 0.9, implying either inhibition of
      phase separation in this region or insufficient equilibration time in the
      experiments. <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>It is now interesting to see how compositions of both solid solution
      phases change with total <i>X</i> (Sr) in solid. It is easy - we just
      have to "clone"&nbsp; the previously created GtDemo record and change some
      parts in the sampler definition. In the "Record" menu, select <tt>"Save
        as"</tt> , change the record key to "<tt>Default:SysEq:GT:1:CaSrCO3SS_sx:"</tt>,
      press <tt>"Ok"</tt> and then select <tt>"Record" "Remake"</tt> menu
      item. Select "SysEq" in the appearing list, press <tt>"Ok"</tt> and again
      <tt>"Remake"</tt> button. Now we need four lines for mole fractions of two
      end members in two phases, and we will not plot any experimental points.
      So, find the <tt>gDimXY[0,1]</tt> cell and enter 6 there, then enter
      zeros into <tt>gDimEf[0,0]</tt> and <tt>gDimEf[0,1] </tt>fields, and
      turn off (to <tt>'-'</tt>) the <tt>GDps[0,0]</tt> flag. Press <tt>"Ok"</tt>
      when finished. The record key template and list of SysEq record keys
      appear again, all the keys are already selected, simply press <tt>"Ok"</tt>.
      In the "GtDemo" window, change GDname field to: <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <blockquote><tt>Mole fractions of Ca and Sr end members in SS phases</tt></blockquote>
    <p><br>
      Put <tt>"Mol fr."</tt> to <tt>gY_Nam</tt> field. Six entries in <tt>gLnam</tt>
      list can be changed to <tt>"X1Ca", "X1Sr", "X2Ca", "X2Sr", "mX1,g",
        "mX2,g". </tt>There are many ways to write a math script for picking up
      mole fractions of solid solution end members; here is just one of them, in
      tune with the previous script: <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <blockquote><tt>$ Determine total Sr mole fraction % in solid</tt> <br>
      <tt>x0[jR] =: ( b[\i{Sr}] - bXa[0][{Sr}] ) *100 /</tt> <br>
      <tt>&nbsp; ( b[{Sr}] - bXa[0][{Sr}] + b[{Ca}] - bXa[0][{Ca}] );</tt> <br>
      <tt>$ Collect % mole fractions of Ca and Sr in SS phases</tt> <br>
      <tt>y0[jR][0] =: Wxx[\j{oxygen}+1]*100;</tt> <br>
      <tt>y0[jR][1] =: Wxx[{oxygen}+2]*100;</tt> <br>
      <tt>y0[jR][2] =: Wxx[{oxygen}+3]*100;</tt> <br>
      <tt>y0[jR][3] =: Wxx[{oxygen}+4]*100;</tt> <br>
      <tt>$ Masses of SS phases in grams</tt> <br>
      <tt>y0[jR][4] =: phM[2];</tt> <br>
      <tt>y0[jR][5] =: phM[3];</tt> <br>
      <tt>$ End</tt></blockquote>
    <p><br>
      <tt>Wxx</tt> is the data vector containing calculated mole fractions for
      species in multi-component phases. The <tt>oxygen</tt> gas stays in the
      DC list just before aragonite end member of the first solid solution
      phase, and this name is used in the script to avoid warnings that there
      are two species named "<tt>aragonite</tt>". <tt>phM</tt> is a vector
      containing masses of phases (see <tt>EqPh</tt> page of "EqDemo" window).
      Put this script into <tt>gExpr</tt> field (remove old contents before)
      and run the data sampler by clicking on the <tt>"Calculate"</tt> icon.
      When finished, plot the data and customize the graph (assign different
      colors to lines, adjust the grid and so on). <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>Take a look first at the <tt>"mX1,g" </tt>and<tt> "mX2,g"</tt> lines
      showing amounts of Ca-strontianite and Sr-aragonite phases, respectively.
      Both phases co-exist in a wide region of total <i>X</i> (Sr)&nbsp; values
      from 0.5 to 86 %, where the quantity of the first one increases and that
      of the second one decreases, while mole fractions of end-member remain
      fixed (i.e. fill out a miscibility gap at very low Sr content in aragonite
      and ca. 14% CaCO<sub>3</sub> in strontianite). At&nbsp; <i>X</i> (Sr) =
      86%, the Sr-aragonite phase disappears and mole fractions of end-members
      in Ca-strontianite change linearly towards composition of pure
      strontianite; quantity of this phase now practically remains constant. <br>

    <h4> <a name="P3201"></a><tt>3.2.10. Some Hints, Tips and Tricks</tt></h4>
    On<tt> EqStat dialog </tt>window, there is a "FIA Simplex" checkbox below
    the "GEM IPM" button. This checkbox (checked on by default) defines which
    initial approximation will be used for entering a feasible domain of the IPM
    minimzation problem. "FIA Simplex" on means that a linearized problem is
    solved first using the simplex method linear programming subroutine, then a
    special procedure for entering the feasible domain is performed which
    involves all phases and species included into the problem (see more in
    Karpov, Chudnenko and Kulik, 1997). This scheme guarantees correct selection
    of stable phases and calculation of redox state parameters, and should
    always be used when an equilibrium is calculated for the first time for a
    given system configuration. In aqueous systems, the full sequence usually
    requires 40 to 120 iterations. However, if only a small change in
    composition or T,P is specified for the next calculation then the
    equilibrium speciation from the previously-calculated SysEq record can be
    directly used as a feasible-domain initial approximation&nbsp; for the IPM
    algorithm. In this case, only a few iterations of IPM are needed, which can
    save a lot of computing time. Try this mode by unchecking the "FIA Simplex"
    box and pressing the "GEM IPM" button. Even if nothing has been changed in
    the system definition, doing this usually results in much better precision
    od mass balance. Beware, however, that the direct entering into IPM retains
    only phases and species which have been selected in non-zero quantities
    during the preceding, "FIA Simplex" calculation, and may (theoretically)
    give wrong results if the bulk composition or stability of some phases have
    changed significantly. So, if in doubt, it is always better to check with
    the "FIA Simplex" on.
    <p>Some bulk compositions, inconsistent thermodynamic data or highly
      non-ideal solution phases may sometimes cause difficult convergence or
      error messages of the IPM module. In many cases, the problem can be
      successfully solved after some adjustment of the numeric control
      parameters of the IPM minimization algorithm. These parameters are saved
      inside of the Profile records and can hence be kept different in separate
      user-created system profiles. To adjust the parameters, go in "Computation
      of Equilibria" mode of GEMS, select the system profile and press&nbsp; the
      "Numeric Settings..."&nbsp; button on the "Computation of Equilibria"
      dialog to get in a&nbsp; "Profile" window. <br>
      <a name="P3211"></a> <br>
      If IPM algorithm did not converge or did it after more than 200
      iterations, increase Pa_DK threshold value three times and try again.
      Sometimes the FIA Simplex procedure cannot enter the fesible domain and an
      error message about that is dispayed. In this case, increase the Pa_DHB
      threshold 10 times and try to calculate again (this will also increase the
      mass balance deviations in the calculated equilibrium state).&nbsp; Other
      important controls are&nbsp; Pa_DB (minimum number of moles in the bulk
      composition) and&nbsp; Pa_DS (cutoff number of moles for phase
      elimination). Bad convergence of IPM in highly non-ideal system can often
      be avoided by changing the&nbsp; Pa_AG factor to 0.4 - 0.5 and&nbsp;
      Pa_DGC to 0.3. Setting Pa_DGC to a negative value &gt; -1 reverts to the
      old method of IPM tinkle suppression for highly non-ideal systems&nbsp;
      (Karpov et al., 1997). If you want to make these changes effective during
      next work sessions, save them by pressing&nbsp; "Save"&nbsp; pictogram or
      selecting&nbsp; "Record" - "Save" pop-up menu line. In general,
      adjustments of this kind require a considerable experience in
      thermodynamic modeling with GEM/Selektor codes. </p>
    <p>GEMS is capable to calculate equilibria when several highly non-ideal
      phases are included into the system (Karpov et al., 1997). This, however,
      poses specific problems of uniqueness of the result and of attaining
      convergence of IPM algorithm. The first problem is important when some
      phases have positive excess Gibbs energy and exsolution (or liquation) may
      occur. This is a matter of correct problem statement and usage of special
      "activity coefficients" for the initial Simplex approximation. The second
      problem is solved in GEMS by introducing a global smoothing parameter
      which controls increments to chemical potentials of species due to the
      non-ideality or electrostatic corrections. This "Pa_AG" parameter can be
      reset in the <a href="../../../../../../../../W:/Shared/SYNCHRO/ToDoInGEMS/GEMS3HTML/doc/html/ge_howto.html#P3211">"Numeric
        Settings"</a> screenform. It takes initial value at first 50 IPM
      iterations, then decreases in about 10 times next 30 iterations (depending
      on Pa_DGC), 10 times more - at next 20 iterations and so on. In most
      cases, good convergence is achieved in 70 to 130 iterations even in very
      non-ideal systems. <br>

    <p><br>
      What to do if you have reached a conclusion that an aqueous complex or
      solid phase are missing in the system profile you worked with? Or you do
      not like some thermodynamic data in the GEM-Selektor kernel database and
      want to replace them? These situations are very typical in geochemical
      modelling and may sometimes need a lot of effort to be resolved. <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>In GEM-Selektor, it is easy to do thermodynamic database extensions and
      make them available to your system profile, although this requires some
      understanding on how the thermodynamic database is organized and
      maintained. You may skip the following five paragraphs if you are already
      familiar with GEMS thermodynamic data framework. <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <blockquote><a name="TDB_OVERVIEW"></a>The GEM-Selektor thermodynamic
      database has four levels of data, kept in the IComp, DComp, ReacDC, and
      Phase record types (chains). The <a href="gm_icomp.html">IComp</a> chain
      contains records defining Independent Components (IC), or stoichiometry
      units, which form a common stoichiometry basis for expressing&nbsp;
      composition of chemical systems and species. The IComp symbols (mainly
      chemical elements and charge), and only them, can be used in writing&nbsp;
      <a href="g_useref.html#FORMULA">chemical formulae</a>&nbsp; of&nbsp;
      thermodynamic&nbsp; species, or Dependent Components (DC), which are
      stored in&nbsp; <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a>&nbsp; or&nbsp; <a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a>&nbsp;
      database records. DC formulae are automatically processed for calculation
      of the species molar mass, formula charge, checking consistency of
      thermodynamic data, and producing stoichiometry matrices for calculation
      of chemical equilibria. In addition, IComp records contain default valence
      numbers of elements to simplify chemical formulae, as well as values of
      absolute entropy of elements, needed for conversions between standard
      molar Gibbs energy, enthalpy and entropy of chemical species. <br>
      &nbsp;
      <p>DComp records keep the formulae and standard state thermodynamic
        properties of solid, gas, liquid and aqueous species (DC) in
        "thermochemical" format. Namely, it includes the standard molar
        properties (or standard partial molal properties) at reference pressure
        and temperature: Gibbs energy <i>G<sup>o</sup></i>&nbsp; and enthalpy <i>H<sup>o</sup>&nbsp;</i>
        of formation from IC (chemical elements) at standard states, absolute
        entropy <i>S<sup>o</sup>&nbsp;</i> and molar volume <i>V<sup>o</sup></i>
        . Optionally, the <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a> records may contain
        vectors of empirical <i>Cp<sup>o</sup> </i>= <i>f </i>(<i>T </i>),
        <i>V<sup>o</sup> </i>= <i>f </i>(<i>T,P</i> ), equation -of - state
        coefficients etc., necessary for <a href="theortdb.html">calculation of
          standard thermodynamic properties at elevated pressures and
          temperatures</a>. All the numbers contained in DComp records refer to
        the stoichiometry of this particular species, rather than to its
        reaction with other species. In other words, data in different DComp
        records are connected only through IC stoichiometries of species and
        information kept in IComp records. <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p><a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a> records are used for defining
        thermodynamic properties of aqueous and surface complexes and minerals
        for which thermochemical data are not available or too uncertain. For
        such species, only log<i>K</i>&nbsp; of the dissolution, association or
        surface complexation reaction is usually known (often predicted at 25 <sup>o</sup>C
        or other temperatures). Thus, a ReacDC record describes the reaction and
        its properties (and also <i>T,P</i>&nbsp; dependence of&nbsp; log<i>K</i>
        ). Because GEM algorithms cannot use reactions and stability constants
        directly for calculation of equilibria, ReacDC record also provides a
        full set of standard (partial molal) thermodynamic properties for a
        "new" species, computed from the properties of the reaction and that of
        all other species involved in the reaction. The "new", reaction-defined
        compound, actually, gives a name to the reaction and to the ReacDC <a href="gemstdbm.html#P3324">record
          key</a>. Thermodynamic properties of this compound are automatically
        maintained consistent (to that of other species involved into the
        reaction) at all temperatures and pressures. The "involved" species must
        already exist in the database as either <a href="gemstdbm.html#P33D3">DComp</a>
        or other ReacDC records: a given ReacDC definition can refer to other
        ReacDC records (but not to itself), thus forming a "reaction chain" (up
        to seven levels of recursion are supported). Any reaction chain always
        terminates with a reaction which refers to DComp records only.
        Several&nbsp; <a href="theortdb.html">methods of calculation</a> of
        thermodynamic properties of reaction-defined species at elevated&nbsp; <i>T,P&nbsp;
          </i>are available in GEM-Selektor. ReacDC module is a unique feature
        of GEMS, to our knowledge, not yet available in full elsewhere.
        Accordingly, the GEM-Selektor database is the first in a sense that
        thermochemical data and reactions are used together for any kind of
        geochemical modelling and data consistency is automatically maintained.
        <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p><a href="gm_phase.html">Phase</a> definition records put together links
        to input data from both DComp and ReacDC record types. Design of
        GEM-Selektor requires that each (even a single- component) phase to be
        taken into calculation of equilibrium states must be&nbsp; described in
        a separate <a href="gm_phase.html">Phase</a> record, with (unique)
        phase name appearing in the <a href="gemstdbm.html#P3326">Phase record
          key</a>. <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a> or <a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a>
        definitions do not contain all information for defining structure and
        behavior of the single- or multi-component phases. In fact, any data
        describing the non-ideal mixing behavior of end-members is valid for a
        particular model of phase only, and alternative representations are
        often possible. The flexible Phase data structure permits formulation of
        a large variety of crystalline and dispersed, liquid and gaseous,
        adsorption and ion-exchange ideal or non-ideal phases which may occur in
        different (geo)chemical systems. Please, note that <a href="gm_profil.html">System
          Profiles</a> in GEMS are constructed from Phase definitions, i.e. the
        profile cannot "see" any DComp or ReacDC records which are not referred
        to by at least one Phase record accessible to the profile. <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>What does it mean "accessible"? In GEM-Selektor, every database chain
        consists of several files, usually located in two places: a "kernel
        database" and a "user's profile" directories. The write-protected
        "kernel database" directory contains IComp, DComp, ReacDC and Phase
        database files with more or less "standard" thermodynamic data for major
        and many minor chemical elements; is supplied and installed together
        with GEMS program and help files. The user's profile directory is
        automatically created when the user creates a new system profile for
        his/her modelling applications; this is the only place where all the
        input data provided by the user and calculation results can be stored.
        Any time, the database file can be linked in or out of the current
        database configuration of GEM-Selektor. When a file is linked in, all
        the records it contains become "visible" for the user and the program in
        record key lists. Accordingly, these records become "invisible" and
        inaccessible after the file has been linked out. New database files can
        be any time created by the user in his profile directory and linked in,
        if necessary.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Although the GEM-Selektor kernel thermodynamic database can be used for
      solving many various geochemical problems (see <a href="g_tutor.html">Tutorial</a>),
      almost every study involving thermodynamic modeling, sooner or later,
      faces a problem of inconsistency or incompleteness of thermodynamic data.
      It is therefore necessary to have convenient tools to handle the data,
      check and match them, and incorporate into equilibria calculations. The
      tradition, however, is such that most of modeling codes contain files with
      thermodynamic data from published databases but still no tools to work
      with the data (except using them for speciation calculations). <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>There are some specialized codes such as SUPCRT92 [<a href="g_litref.html#%5B1992JOH/OEL%5D">1992JOH/OEL</a>]
      which handle the thermodynamic database, calculate user-specified
      reactions, plot them on diagrams, but they cannot calculate equilibria in
      multi-component systems. Moreover, most of speciation programs based on
      the Law of Mass Action (LMA) algorithm (like PHREEQC2 [<a href="g_litref.html#%5B1999PAR/APP%5D">1999PAR/APP</a>]
      or MINTEQA2 [1991ALL/BRO] use thermodynamic data exclusively in the form
      of reaction equilibrium constants <i>K</i>&nbsp; for the "product"
      species plus dependences of <i>K</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; on temperature and/or
      pressure. Thermochemical data must be recalculated first into log<i>K</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      values (e.g., as in EQ3/6&nbsp; [1992WOL]) to be used in such codes. There
      are, however, special utility programs PMATCH [1989PEA/AVI] and PM2SEL
      [1999DMY/KUL] which can help in checking the internal consistency of&nbsp;
      thermodynamic data and convert it into different formats. <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>Programs based on GEM algorithms (e.g., ChemGeo, GIBBS, GEM-Selektor), on
      the contrary, accept only the standard partial molar(molal) values of
      Gibbs energy for all species <i>g<sup>o </sup></i>(<i>T,P&nbsp; </i>),
      so any data represented as log<i>K</i> (<i>T,P&nbsp; </i>) must first be
      converted to <i>g<sup>o </sup></i>(<i>T,P&nbsp; </i>) values before
      usage in GEM modeling calculations. In this case, it is not easy to extend
      thermodynamic database with consistent data for some new components if
      their thermochemical properties are not known. Hence, the structure of
      GEM-Selektor database has been designed to help in overcoming these
      difficulties. <br>

    <p>When you press the "<tt>Thermodynamic Database</tt>" button on
      GEM-Selektor Main dialog, you will see a "Thermodynamic Database" dialog
      window with six large buttons for accessing the <a href="gm_icomp.html">IComp</a>,
      <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a>, <a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a>, <a
        href="gm_rtparm.html">RTparm</a>, <a href="gm_compos.html">Phase</a>
      and <a href="gm_compos.html">Compos</a> module windows, described in the
      corresponding manuals. The respective six database chains contain records
      with all the input data necessary for building GEM chemical models, linked
      together into the System Profile ("Default" in this exercise). Part of
      database files in each chain belongs to the kernel database which you can
      use but not modify; another part belongs to your own "Default" profile
      directory; all extensions and changes you make can be stored there and
      only there. In other words, the kernel database will remain unaffected by
      your personal modifications of thermodynamic data, and your own work will
      retain compatibility with system profiles created by other GEMS users. <br>

    <h4> <a name="3_3_1_override_data"></a>3.3.1 Overriding data in kernel
      database</h4>
    &nbsp;
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <p>A typical case (especially for experienced modellers) is when the user
      refuses&nbsp; thermodynamic data for some species or minerals provided in
      the kernel database, but the corresponding records cannot be changed
      because they are write-protected. Of course, you could create a new DComp
      or ReacDC records with different names for those species and type in your
      favorite numbers; after the system profile is open next time, you should
      not forget to switch off the "primarily provided" species from the SysEq
      selection lists. But GEM- Selektor offers&nbsp; a far more elegant way - <i>an
        override mechanism of record selection, </i>which applies to lists of
      record keys in ReacDC, Phase, and Profile/SysEq data structures only. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <blockquote>In the GEMS database, structurized <a href="gdb_rkey.html">record
key
        formats</a> are supported.&nbsp; For instance, <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a>
      and <a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a> record key formats are identical
      and include four fields - phase state, group, species name, and comment
      (data set code). The primary idea of these formats was to keep long lists
      of DC record keys in a well-structurized way as the database chain index
      is alphabetically sorted, so that aqueous species are first, gases next,
      and minerals at the end. Within aqueous species list, the group name
      (second field) usually refers to metal cation or ligand, so all complexes
      of a given metal are conveniently held together in the lists. Actually,
      the species name is the most important because it may appear in the (case
      sensitive) <a href="gmscript.html">math scripts.</a>&nbsp; The fourth
      field serves to indicate the original data set from where the data were
      taken and (optionally) grade of their uncertainty.</blockquote>
    <p><a name="OVERRIDE"></a>The <b><i>override mechanism</i></b>&nbsp;
      consists in that the last field of the record key is actually ignored when
      the records are loaded during processing of the lists of record keys
      in&nbsp; ReacDC, Phase and Profile/SysEq data structures. So, when the
      program finds more than one&nbsp; record with the same record key fields
      except the last one,&nbsp; it simply takes in a record keyed
      alphabetically the first and ignores others; no warnings are issued. <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>Let us check how the override mechanism works using a celestite (SrSO<sub>4</sub>)
      example. From the "Thermodynamic Database" dialog, press the <tt>"Dependent
Components
        (DComp)" </tt>button. In appearing "DComp" window, click on the "Show"
      icon (first from the left) and in the list, select the line <tt>s:SrSO:celestite:rs:</tt>&nbsp;
and
      press <tt>"Ok"</tt>. You will see the DComp record for celestite from
      GEMS kernel database which contains data from the USGS dataset [<a href="g_litref.html#%5B1995ROB/HEM%5D">1995ROB/HEM</a>]&nbsp;
(indicated
      by&nbsp; <tt>rs</tt>&nbsp; in the last record key field). The drawback of
      this data is absence of <i>Cp<sup>o</sup></i> = <i>f </i>(<i>T </i>)
      coefficients and heat capacity value at 25 <sup>o</sup>C (check on <tt>Page
        2</tt> of "DComp" window), thus making temperature extrapolation
      impossible. Fortunately, data for celestite is also available from the
      SUPCRT92 database [<a href="g_litref.html#%5B1992JOH/OEL%5D">1992JOH/OEL</a>]
      with Majer-Kelly coefficients valid up to 1500 K (both data are compared
      below in J/mol): <br>

    <p>The SUPCRT92 data for celestite originate from a compilation by
      H.Helgeson and others [1978HEL/DEL]; it allows for temperature
      extrapolation and provides ca. 0.2 p<i>K</i> unit lower solubility of
      celestite at 25 <sup>o</sup>C, compared to the data from [<a href="g_litref.html#%5B1995ROB/HEM%5D">1995ROB/HEM</a>],
      as seen from the difference in values of&nbsp; <i>G<sup>o</sup><sub>298</sub></i>
      . <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>To use SUPCRT92 data for celestite in equilibria calculations, select <tt>"Record"
        "Save As"</tt> menu commands in order to create a new <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a>
      record with identical first three key fields and an alphabetically higher
      fourth field. A small dialog entitled "DComp: Insert new record keyed"
      appears, with the&nbsp; <tt>s:SrSO:celestite:rs3: </tt>record key
      disassembled into four editor lines. Change only the last (fourth) line
      from&nbsp; <tt>"rs3"</tt> to <tt>"h78"</tt> (or any other alphabetically
      preceding value) and press <tt>"Ok"</tt>.&nbsp; You will see a selection
      list entitled "Choose database file to put a record..." with DComp
      database file names, currently linked to GEMS. Select a&nbsp; <tt>dcomp.Default
        </tt>file (other files belong to the kernel database and are
      write-protected) and press <tt>"Ok"</tt>. <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>Now, the DComp window appears again with previous contents, but under
      different record key. Enter data from the above table (right column) into
      <tt>Page 1</tt> there (heat capacity coefficients and their validity
      temperature interval into <tt>Page 2</tt>). Change reference in dSDref
      field on <tt>Page 1</tt> to <tt>"Helgeson_ea:1978:pap:".</tt> Press <tt>"Calculate"</tt>
      icon (or <tt>F9</tt>). A small dialog with a question "Calculate standard
      values ..." appears; press<tt> "Yes"</tt> - this will check consistency of
      standard properties and calculate <i>Cp<sup>o</sup><sub>298</sub></i>
      value for celestite from the Majer-Kelly coefficients that you entered on
      <tt>Page 2</tt>. If this value is not 107.83 then the <i>Cp<sup>o</sup></i>
      = <i>f </i>(<i>T </i>) coefficients were not entered correctly; if so
      then check numbers entered on <tt>Page 2</tt> and&nbsp; repeat
      calculation. Press <tt>"Save"</tt> icon when finished. You can also
      perform data restoration and consistency checks; for instance, put "Empty"
      value (`) into the <tt>H0d[0]</tt> cell and press <tt>"Calculate"</tt>
      button. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>Upon the next calculation, any reference to celestite in ReacDC, Phase
      records and Profile/SysEq structures will operate with your new data for
      celestite, without any furtner reconfiguration. <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>A little bit more complicated change is needed when you wish to replace <a
        href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a> data for a mineral but you have only
      reaction logK and can create <a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a> record
      only. This requires to override <a href="gm_phase.html">Phase</a>
      definition which refers to this species: just copy it (using a "Record"
      "Save as" menu command) with alphabetically higher last record key field
      into your <tt>phase.&lt;profilename&gt;.pdb</tt> file (). Then remake new
      phase definition so that it would point to your own ReacDC record. Done! <br>

      &nbsp; </p>
    <h4> <a name="3_3_2_insert_new"></a>3.3.2 Inserting new species and phases</h4>
    <p><br>
      Second typical (and not so rare) case is that, after some modeling
      sessions, you have reached a conclusion that a mineral and/or an aqueous
      complex,&nbsp; which in reality most probably define measured metal
      concentrations, are missing from your modeling system. There is nothing
      unusual - no thermodynamic database is complete, not even the GEM-Selektor
      kernel database. It is more important to have effiicient tools for
      extending your database and system formulations. Such tools are at your
      disposal! <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>The simplest case is adding aqueous or gaseous species if your <a href="gm_profil.html">system
        profile</a> uses default (automatically assembled during opening of the
      profile) aqueous and gas phases. All you have to do is to collect
      thermodynamic data and create missing <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a>
      and/or <a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a> records in database extension
      files in your profile directory. We recommend keeping up with the style of
      record keys used in the kernel database. These new species will be taken
      into all your SysEq definitions when you select the "Computation of
      Equilibria" mode and open your profile next time (press "Ok" on warnings
      about detection of your newly inserted species). <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>Please, do not forget to re-calculate all equilibria already stored in
      SysEq records in your profile! The program automatically updates
      indexation in <a href="gm_syseq.html">SysEq</a> records after some
      species were excluded or added from/to the system profile, but it cannot
      decide in which cases these species can affect modelling results, so this
      is left to your discretion. <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>If you wish to add mineral phases to your system, first check whether the
      respective DComp records are available in the kernel database - Phase
      definitions are provided there only for the most commonly used minerals.
      If this is the case, simply create missing <a href="gm_phase.html">Phase
        definition</a> records. If not - then create <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a>
      or <a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a> record, enter thermodynamic data,
      and save the record in one of the database extension files in your profile
      directory (best is to load some of the existing records and use them as
      templates by applying "Record" "Save As" menu command). Then&nbsp; create
      a new Phase record (single- or multi-component phases) and remake it to
      point to the new DC record. New phases and components will be
      automatically inserted into System Profile lists upon the next opening of
      the profile. Do not forget to recalculate those <a href="gm_syseq.html">SysEq</a>
      records (system definitions) in which you deem the new phases to be
      stable! <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>One important remark about non-aqueous and non-gaseous phases and their
      components: the system profile is assembled by picking up all records
      available in the current Phase database chain (with due regard to the
      override mechanism). Only those <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a> and <a
        href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a> records will be selected that are
      referred to in <a href="gm_phase.html">Phase</a> records. This means that
      some species or minerals in your database extension may not be used in
      equilibria calculations if you (on purpose or by chance) did not include
      them into Phase record lists. <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>Creating definitions of single component condensed phases is by far the
      simplest task because such a definition does not include any math script
      equations and refers only to one species (the system profile <a href="gemstdbm.html#OVERRIDE">override
        mechanism</a> applies for loading DComp/ReacDC data referred to in <a href="gm_phase.html">Phase
        definitions</a>). In a Remake configuration window which comes after you
      have specified the new <a href="gdb_rkey.html#dbm_Phase">Phase record key</a>,
      check that <tt>"NNNNNN"</tt> is entered into<tt> p_solt</tt>&nbsp; fields
      with <a href="g_useref.html#NONIDTYPES">codes for non-ideality phase
        types;</a>&nbsp; either of <tt>"l", "s"</tt> or <tt>"d"</tt> code
      stays in the <tt>Ph_Ps[0,0]</tt><a href="g_useref.html#PHASETYPES">phase
        class field</a>, and press "Ok". Then select one species from DComp or
      ReacDC record lists that appear later. Type in the phase name and check
      that <tt>"O"</tt> (single component) code is present in the <tt>PhDCC</tt>
      (species class) field. Finally, save the new phase definition record into
      one of your profile extension database files. <br>

      then issued. Some other errors can be detected only when a series of
      thermodynamic data for varying <i>T,P</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; is computed and
      plotted on graphs. Thus, the RTparm module and window screen forms are
      provided for facilitating the process of "debugging"&nbsp; thermodynamic
      data and their <i>T,P</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; dependencies for individual
      species. <a href="gm_rtparm.html">RTparm</a> module takes input data from
      Dcomp or ReacDC record with the four first fields same as in the <a href="gdb_rkey.html#dbm_RTParm">RTparm
        record key</a>. The <a href="gemstdbm.html#OVERRIDE">override mechanism</a>
      does not apply to RTparm lists in order to make it possible to compare
      different representation of temperature-pressure trends for one species. <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>Several RTPARM records can be created for one DCOMP or REACDC record, and
      up to four such records can be plotted together on graphs, e.g., for
      comparison of different temperature extrapolations. The RTPARM function,
      taken together with flexibility of DCOMP and REACDC definitions
      implemented in GEMS, provides a new level of matching and user's extension
      of thermodynamic database, and can save a lot of time and effort in
      putting together various data needed for modeling systems of environmental
      geochemical interest. Since the same DCthermo() and RCthermo() routines
      are used in both RTPARM and <a href="gemstdbm.html#P3250">System Profile</a>
      calculations, the tests done by RTPARM will make you confident that
      nothing unexpected can happen with thermodynamic data during calculation
      of equilibria at non-ambient temperatures and pressures. <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>As usual, new RTPARM calculations are performed in GEMS by creating new
      records. In a Remake configuration window (invoked by <a href="gemstdbm.html#P333R2">Remake</a>
      or <a href="gemstdbm.html#P333R3">Create</a> commands), the user can
      specify how many points for temperature and pressure will be calculated,
      which thermodynamic data collected and how they will be displayed on four
      plots. This is done using flags and switches (equipped with help messages
      popping up at mouse pointer, as usual). After pressing OK, the RTPARM
      screen form appears again, there minimum, maximum temperature-pressure and
      their increments can be specified if different from default (0 to 375 <sup>o</sup>C
      in 15 <sup>o</sup>C increments at P<sub>SAT</sub>). <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>Calculations are performed&nbsp; with <a href="gemstdbm.html#P333R4">Calculate</a>
      command; when finished, up to four graphs are displayed on <tt>"Record" "<a
          href="gemstdbm.html#P333R8">Plot</a>"</tt> menu command and can be <a
        href="gemstdbm.html#P3290">customized</a> as in <a href="gemstdbm.html#P3280">GTDEMO</a>
      record. The calculated data can also be printed into a text file using a <tt>"Record"
        "<a href="gemstdbm.html#P333R9">Print</a>" </tt>command. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>

    <h4> <a name="3_3_4_create_PCO"></a>3.3.4 Creating Predefined Composition
      Object (PCO) definitions</h4>
    <p><br>
      A useful extension of your modeling tollbox is creating GCO definitions (<a
        href="gemstdbm.html#P33D2">Compos</a> records) and storing them in your
      <tt>/compos.&lt;pname&gt;.pdb</tt> file. It helps much in setting bulk
      compositions of systems in a neat and transparent way, especially for
      simulation of such processes as mixing , evaporation, weathering etc. As
      usual in GEMS, the easiest way is to "clone" existing Compos records with
      <a href="gemstdbm.html#P333R3">Create</a> or <a href="gemstdbm.html#P333R6">Save
        As</a> menu commands, remaking and re-calculating them whenever
      appropriate. The new Compos record keys will be automatically added to the
      <a href="gemstdbm.html#P3400">System Profile</a> when you open it next
      time. </p>
    <p>Let us consider an example of creating a new Compos record for the
      kaolinite stoichiometry. First, press "Show" button to get the
      record&nbsp; "<tt>Kaolinite:MIN:Al2Si2O5(OH)4:</tt>". You will see&nbsp; a
      very simple screen where composition of kaolinite is expressed in moles of
      chemical elements in the "CI" vector. The MasVol[0] cell shows kaolinite
      molar mass in kg, and MasVol[6] displays the total number of moles of
      elements per mole of kaolinite. </p>
    <p>Try to express the same composition in mole percents of petrogenic oxides
      Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O. First,
      execute&nbsp; "Record" "<a href="gemstdbm.html#P333R3">Create</a>"
      command, modify the previous record key as follows: "<tt>Kaolinite1:MIN:Moles_oxides:</tt>"
      and press OK. In appearing "Reorganization of data fields" dialog, press "<tt>Remake</tt>"
      button. In the next "Compos: Remake parameters" dialog, turn first switch
      off and third switch on. In counters to the right, put zero into fist one
      and 3 (number of required formulae for petrogenic oxides) into third
      counter, and press <tt>OK</tt>. In c_icbc selection list which appears
      next, check "Clear All" and then "Proceed" buttons. </p>
    <p>Now, the "Compos::" screen form appears, with empty&nbsp; list of
      formulae "formU". Type SiO2 into its first line; Al2O3 into second and H2O
      into third line. Now,&nbsp; specify composition of kaolinite in "CA"
      vector (to the right) by entering 2 against SiO2 formula, 1 against Al2O3
      and 2 against H2O. These numbers will be interpreted depending on <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6104">units
        of measurement</a> coded in the&nbsp; "AUcl" vector (in between), and
      then will be converted to numbers of moles and added to bulk GCO
      composition. By default, 'M' letters (numbers of moles) appear in AUcl. Be
      careful with MasVol[0] and MasVol[6] cells because they are used for
      normalizing the composition you have specified to certain mass or total
      number of IC moles, respectively. MasVol[0] contains total mass of
      geochemical object Ms in kg.&nbsp; If 0 or EMPTY value ` were specified by
      the user then mass fractions can not be used and Ms will be automatically
      calculated from moles or molar (molal) concentrations. A positive value
      should be entered in MasVol[0] cell if at least one value in CI, CD or CA
      vectors is specified as mass percent&nbsp; '%'&nbsp; in classifiers CIcl,
      CDcl or CAcl. In our kaolinite example, type zero into MasVol[6] and 0.1
      into MasVol[0] cells.&nbsp; Now, press "Calculate"&nbsp; to calculate 100
      g of kaolinite stoichiometry (you will see new&nbsp; numbers in the
      leftmost "Cm" vector), and "Save" to save the new record to database (do
      not forget to delete this exercise before you open the System Profile next
      time). </p>
    <p>&nbsp;It is important that each element of CI, CD or CA vectors (and
      their equivalents in SysEq dialog) can be set up in different <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6104">units
        of measurement</a>. This is very convenient and gives the user an
      unprecedented freedom in working with bulk compositions or modifying them.
      When specifying different units, one should take care of their base
      quantities. For example, when setting molality units, a mass of
      water-solvent should always be set. Read carefully all the help lines to
      MasVol cells for instructions how to set base quantities and units of
      measurement correctly. Examination of available Compos records and some
      experimentation will give you the right feeling how&nbsp; to work with GCO
      records. Negative numbers can be used in CI, CD and CA vectors as long as
      they do not produce negative numbers of moles in the total GCO composition
      "Cm" vector. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <h4> <a name="3_3_5_update_profile"></a>3.3.5 Updating the System Profile</h4>
    <p><br>
      This is done automatically when the user enters "Computation of
      Equilibria" mode of GEM-Selektor and selects a system profile from the
      appearing list. If some records in thermodynamic database have been
      created or deleted, a warning appears in each case. Press "Ok" to confirm
      changes or "Cancel" if the record was inserted or deleted by mistake (in
      the latter case, you will need to fix the problem before attempting to
      open your system profile again). After insertion of some phases and
      species into the profile, it is usually necessary to re-calculate at least
      part of <a href="gm_syseq.html">SysEq</a> records produced before (and
      maybe, also some <a href="gm_proces.html">Process</a>&nbsp; and <a href="gm_gtdemo.html">GtDemo</a>
      definitions). <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>The usual case for removing some phases from the profile (i.e. respective
      Phase records from thermodynamic database) is that, after all the
      necessary models have been calculated, it happens that these phases never
      appeared in equilibria. Cleaning such phases out helps in keeping your
      profile lists smaller and easier to look through. In this situation, it is
      not necessary to re-calculate all the SysEq records because nothing is
      going to change. <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <h4> <a name="3_3_6_rerun_syseq"></a>3.3.6 Re-running already calculated
      equilibria</h4>
    <p><br>
      There are two ways for re-calculating <a href="gm_syseq.html">SysEq</a>
      records: (i) one-by-one (from the "Single Thermodynamic System" dialog)
      and (ii) batch calculations (re-calculation of <a href="gm_proces.html">Process</a>
      definitions, preferable). <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>The one-by-one method is the only possible for the SysEq records which
      are "standalone" or used as "parent" systems for Process definitions. It
      consists of two steps: (1) Press "Load..." button and select the record;
      (2) Press "BCC" and then "IPM" buttons to re-run GEM IPM module. "Accept"
      on the IPM Progress dialog will also save updated SysEq record to
      database. <br>
      &nbsp; </p>
    <p>The batch calculation requires first to open the "Process" window, then
      load the necessary Process record, and press "Calculate" icon or menu item
      to recalculate all SysEq records created by this Process definition.
      Re-calculating all GtDemo definitions related to this process is also
      advisable for re-plotting results and looking what changed. <br>
