Surface complexation on mineral-water interfaces can be calculated in
GEMS in a way similar to non-ideal solid solutions, with account for
surface heterogeneity, multi-site adsorption and surface site
saturation. <br>

<br>

It is assumed that ideal surface binding of ions from bulk aqueous
electrolyte at low fractional surface coverage occurs in water
monolayer in a "linear adsorption region" where the surface density
(concentration) of adsorbed ions
increases proportional to the ion activity in the bulk solution.
Electrostatic effects on charged surface cause the surface complex
concentration differ from the ideal one due to Coulombic correction
terms that depend on the relative surface plane potentials, calculated
from an electrostatic model of choice (CCM, DLM, TLM, XTLM, BSM, XBSM).
Electrostatic corrections can also be ignored if non-electrostatic
model (NEM) is selected for a given surface type on a
given sorbent phase. <br>

&nbsp;<br>

In GEMS, one can have several sorption phases (with known specific
surface area of the sorbent) with up to six different surface types on
each one. Each
surface type can have different EDL model and different maximum site
density
acting for a (non)competitive adsorption of several surface species.
The
site saturation effects are accounted for by &nbsp;using the surface
activity
terms (SAT) - activity-coefficient-like expressions derived from the
Langmuir
isotherm. <br>

<br>

Details about mathematical representation of GEM SCMs and calculation
of Coulombic terms and SAT are given in the <b><big><tt>SCM-corrections.pdf</tt></big></b>
document (see <span style="font-family: monospace;">/program/doc/pdf</span>
directory or GEMS-PSI web page) and references therein. <br>
