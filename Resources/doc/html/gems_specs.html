<h2>Technical Information<br>
</h2>

<p>GEM-Selektor v.3 (GEMS3) is written in C/C++. It has a modern 
windowed multi-document Graphical User's Interface (GUI) that uses the 
functionality of Qt v.4 Toolkit for desktops in the form of 
dynamically-linked libraries and plugins.<br>
  <br>
Qt4 is a cross-platform framework that allows the same source code to be
 compiled and run on all major desktop PC platforms, as well as on some 
mobile devices. Desktop variants of Qt4 available under LGPL v.2.1 
licence are included in the Qt SDK, which can be downloaded from 
http://qt.nokia.com or http://qt-project.org.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
The GEMS3 executable code is produced by linking together Qt dynamic 
load libraries and plugins provided in Qt SDK with the following parts 
compiled with the GNU C++ compilers:<br>
</p>

<ul>

  <li><b>GEMS3K</b> code for solving chemical equilibrium systems by Gibbs 
Energy Minimization (more ...); uses the Jama TNT C++ library (NIST) for
 numerical algebra, but no Qt functionality. GEMS3K code also includes 
the TSolMod class library of built-in models of mixing in 
phases-solutions.</li>
  <li><b>GEMS-Vizor</b> code, which contains all the specific code for simple 
thermodynamic calculations, database management modules, widgets and 
dialogs. This part requires Qt headers for compilation. It also uses 
parts of the SUPCRT92 code (translated from Fortran to C/C++), and parts
 of the TSolMod code.</li>
</ul>

<p>The GEMS3 package also contains a Resources/ folder with 
configuration files, default thermodynamic database, help database, and 
some pdf documentation files. Set of icons used in GEM-Selektor GUI: (c) 2012, <u>Gillian Gr&uuml;</u><u>n</u>. <br>

<h3>Platform-specific information</h3>

<h4>Windows XP/7/8</h4>

<p>GEM-Selektor is built using Qt SDK v.1.2.1 with the MinGW port of GNU
 C++ compiler and linker. It comes as a self-extracting installer 
file&nbsp; having the name</p>

<p>&nbsp; <tt>Gems&lt;ver&gt;-&lt;revGUI&gt;.&lt;revG3K&gt;-win32-install.sfx.exe </tt></p>

<p>where&nbsp; <tt>&lt;ver&gt;</tt>&nbsp; stands for version number (e.g. 3.1), 
<tt>&lt;revGUI&gt;</tt> is the SVN trunk revision number for the GEMS-Vizor part,
 and <tt>&lt;revG3K&gt;</tt> is the SVN trunk revision number for the GEMS3K code
 part. The installer (ca. 13 Mb size) is prepared using the 7-zip SFX 
Maker out of a 7-zip archive that contains a compressed folder <tt>Gems3-app\</tt>
 and files <tt>INSTALL.windows.txt, rungems3.bat</tt> and <tt>Readme3.txt</tt>. The <tt>
INSTALL.windows.txt</tt> file describes how to install GEMS3 on a Windows PC.</p>

<p>When installed, GEM-Selektor occupies ca. 50 Mb on hard disk; a 
modeling project can occupy 1 to 100 Mb depending on the size of project
 chemical system and number of process-generated records. Therefore, at 
least 1 Gb of free HDD space is necessary (SSD disks work much faster). 
The program runs, in principle, on any PC with Intel or AMD processor - 
from netbooks to desktops - but for better performance, a quad-core i7 
or similar processor with 4 Gb RAM or more is recommended. The 
multi-document GUI of GEMS3 looks nice on color displays with 1600 x 900
 or higher resolution.</p>

<h4>Mac OS X (10.6, 10.7, 10.8)</h4>

<p>GEM-Selektor is built using Qt SDK v.1.2.1 which requires the GNU C++
 compiler and linker provided in the actual version of Xcode. GEMS3 
comes as a disk image file having the name</p>

<p>&nbsp; <tt>Gems&lt;ver&gt;-&lt;revGUI&gt;.&lt;revG3K&gt;-OSX-x86-64.dmg </tt></p>

<p>where&nbsp; <tt>&lt;ver&gt;</tt>&nbsp; stands for version number (e.g. 3.1), 
<tt>&lt;revGUI&gt;</tt> is the SVN trunk revision number for the GEMS-Vizor part,
 and <tt>&lt;revG3K&gt;</tt> is the SVN trunk revision number for the GEMS3K code
 part. The installer (ca. 22 Mb size) is prepared using the <tt>macdeployqt</tt> 
utility of Qt SDK from the (updated) <tt>/Applications/gems3.app</tt> application 
that has usual folder structure, as required by OS X.&nbsp;&nbsp; The folder <tt>/Applications/gems3.app/Contents/Resources/</tt> contains a file <tt>INSTALL.macosx.txt</tt> that describes how to install GEMS3 on Mac.</p>

<p>When installed, GEM-Selektor occupies ca. 57 Mb on hard disk; a 
modeling project can occupy 1 to 100 Mb depending on the size of project
 chemical system and number of process-generated records. Therefore, at 
least 1 Gb of free HDD space is necessary (SSD disks work much faster). 
The program runs, in principle, on any Mac with Intel processor and OS X
 10.6 or higher. For better performance, an iMac, Mac Pro, or Mac Book 
Pro quad-core i7 or similar processor with 4 Gb RAM or more is 
recommended. The multi-document GUI of GEMS3 looks nice on color 
displays with 1600 x 900 or higher resolution.</p>

<h4>Linux</h4>

<p>GEM-Selektor is built using Qt SDK v.1.2.1 which uses the native GNU 
C++ compiler and linker. GEMS3 comes as a tar.gzip (tgz) archive file 
having the name</p>

<p>&nbsp;<tt> Gems&lt;ver&gt;-&lt;revGUI&gt;.&lt;revG3K&gt;-linux-x86-&lt;bits&gt;.tgz</tt></p>

<p>where&nbsp; <tt>&lt;ver&gt;</tt>&nbsp; stands for version number (e.g. 3.1), 
<tt>&lt;revGUI&gt;</tt> is the SVN trunk revision number for the GEMS-Vizor part,
 <tt>&lt;revG3K&gt;</tt> is the SVN trunk revision number for the GEMS3K code 
part, and <tt>&lt;bits&gt;</tt> stands for 32 or 64 depending on the linux 
distribution. The installer (ca. 16 Mb size) is prepared on the Ubuntu 
12.04 LTS 32 or 64 by compressing the folder "<tt>~/Gems3-app/</tt>" application 
that contains the "<tt>Resources/</tt>" subfolder, <tt>gems3</tt> executable, and binary 
Qt4 libraries and plugins used by gems3. The folder also contains the 
<tt>gems3.bash</tt> and <tt>gems3.sh</tt> batch files for launching GEMS3 program, and the
<tt> INSTALL.linux.txt </tt>file. Installation of GEMS3 on linux does not require
sudo or root privileges.&nbsp; </p>

<p>When installed, GEM-Selektor occupies ca. 40 Mb on hard disk; a 
modeling project can occupy 1 to 100 Mb depending on the size of project
 chemical system and number of process-generated records. Therefore, at 
least 1 Gb of free HDD space is necessary (SSD disks work much faster). 
The program runs, in principle, on any PC with Intel processor. For 
better performance, a PC with quad-core i7 or similar processor with 4 
Gb RAM or more is recommended. The multi-document GUI of GEMS3 looks 
nice on color displays with 1600 x 900 or higher resolution.</p>

<p>Although the GEMS3 installer for linux is prepared on Ubuntu linux, 
it runs on any other linux distribution for the same architecture, e.g. 
on Kubuntu linux 11 and higher, fedora linux 15 and higher, and openSuSE
 linux 12 and higher. The reason is that the installer contains all the 
necessary binary files form Qt, and is simply a tarball zip archive that
 is supposed to run in the home directory of the user with normal 
privileges.</p>

<p>On some linuxes, the default font size in GEMS module windows may 
appear odd (too small or too large). This can be fixed in Preferences 
Dialog. Start GEMS3 and click "Help" "Preferences" menu command, then 
click the "Change font..." button.</p>
