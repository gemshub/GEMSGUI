<h2><a name="GRAPH_INTRO"></a>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>The Graphics Dialog can be called from Process, GtDemo, RTparm and
GEM2MT modules for graphical presentation (as curve plots, cumulative
plots, or level plots) of GEM simulation results, thermodynamic data,
or any sampled data. The data should be collected into two tables - one
for the abscissa(s) (e.g. xp in Process) and another for the
ordinate(s) (e.g. yp in Process). <br>
</p>

<p>In previous versions of GEM-Selektor, only one column in the
abscissa table and multiple columns in the ordinates table were
possible; each ordinate column could be plotted as a curve against the
same common abscissa. Since this version, multiple columns in the
abscissa table are also allowed, and any column in the ordinate table
can be connected with any existing column in the abscissa table to plot
a curve. This can be done by a double click on an index in the "x#"
column in the Legend area.<br>
</p>

<p>A curve plot consists of the symbol that marks any given data point,
and the line connecting the symbols. Both symbols and lines are
optional - they can be disabled when their size is set to 0. Each curve
plot (ordinate column) has a name (string up to 15 characters long)
which can be edited either in the Legend area on Graph Dialog, or in
the respective data field on the module window. The symbol type, size,
color and the line size can be adjusted in a "Customize plot curve"
dialog that opens upon a mouse click on the symbol in the Legend area.
Legend names can be dragged (using the left mouse button) onto the
plotting canvas and dropped there in appropriate places. To put a
legend name to a different place, just drag it again from the Legend
area on the right-hand side.<br>
</p>

<p>When called from the Process module, in the normal (multiple curves)
mode, the Graphics Dialog can be updated at each process simulation
step, and new positions of curve symbols become visible on top of the
pre-existing plot. To see only newly-calculated curves, simply close
the Graphics Dialog window and open it again (the previous curves will
be lost). If you decide to preserve previously computed curves instead,
then do not save the updated record to database, just re-read it to
restore previous contents. <br>
</p>

<p>To see more detail in a small area of the plot, draw a rectangle
(using the left mouse button) around that area. After the mouse button
is released, the area within the rectangle will be expanded to a full
canvas. To restore the complete plot, click the "Full" button; to see
the fragment&nbsp; again, click the "Fragment" button. <br>
</p>

<p>Clicking on the "Customize" button opens up the <a href="#CUSTOMIZE">"Customize
Graph" dialog</a> where the graph type can be chosen, axis setup
performed, label font adjusted, and the background color can be
selected. <br>
</p>

<p>Clicking on the "Print" button sends the graph image to one of
printers known in the system; the "Save Image" button opens the "Save
Graphics Image" dialog where one of vector- or bitmap graphics formats
can be chosen, as well as the path and file name to contain the saved
image.</p>

<p>The "Help" button opens this help page.<br>
</p>

<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h3><a name="GRAPH_NORMAL_MODE"></a>1.1. Normal Multiple Curves Mode</h3>

<p>This mode is default. The typical appearance of GraphDialog in this
mode is shown below. <br>
</p>

<p><img style="width: 640px; height: 479px;" alt="Graphics Dailog" src="GraphicsDialog.png"> <br>
</p>

<p>Up to 20 curves can be shown on the same plot. Any curve can be
disabled by choosing the abscissa index equal to -1 in the x# column in
the Legend area (this has no effect on data). When the plot is created
for the first time, the colors and symbols in the legend will be
selected automatically and can be adjusted later on.</p>

<p>Click on any symbol under "Legend" opens a "Customize plot curve"
dialog:</p>

<p><img style="width: 509px; height: 268px;" alt="Customize Plot Curve" src="CustomizePlotCurve.png"><br>
</p>

<p>In this dialog, the user can select the line size (thickness); the
symbol size and shape; and change their color (the same for the line
and the symbol belonging to the same plot). If only scattered symbols
must be shown on the plot then set the line size to 0. Setting symbol
size to 0 results in only curves shown. The "Change Color" dialog looks
different under different operation systems. <br>
</p>

<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<h3><a name="GRAPH_CUMULATIVE_MODE"></a>1.2. Cumulative Plot Mode</h3>

<p>The cumulative mode (can be chosen in the <a href="#CUSTOMIZE">Customize
Graph dialog</a>) shows data from the ordinate table (<span style="font-family: monospace;">yp</span>)
that have a constant sum, such as mass fractions or percentages, volume
fractions, rock- or material compositions, and so on, against a common
abscissa <span style="font-family: monospace;">xp</span>. The first
column is shown below as a colored field with the height proportional
to its fraction in each row; each next column is plotted on top of the
already occupied area in the same scale and in different color. Colors
can be adjusted by clicking on the legend symbols, as usual. An example
(cement phase composition as function of added mass of silica fume) is
shown below.<br>
</p>

<p><img style="width: 480px; height: 480px;" alt="Plot in Cumulative mode example" src="PlotCumulativeMode.png"><br>
</p>

<p>In this mode, the plot will not be updated upon simulation, so it
makes no sense to perform Process calculations with Graphics Dialog
open at runtime. <br>
</p>

<h2><a name="CUSTOMIZE"></a>2. Customize Graph Dialog<br>
</h2>

<p>In this dialog, you can select the graph (plot) type; the number of
major grid ticks separately on abscissa and ordinate axis; edit&nbsp;
the name of each axis (to be shown on the plot); adjust scale intervals
for the full plot and the fragment; select the label font and size; and
change the background color. Selection of fonts and colors depends on
the particular operation system of your PC. </p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><img style="width: 569px; height: 390px;" alt="Customize Graph" src="CustomizeGraph.png"><br>
</p>

<p><br>
To make changes operational without closing this dialog, click "Apply".
</p>

<h2><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><a name="GRAPH_SAVE"></a></span>3. Saving and Printing Plot Images<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
</span></h2>

<p>Click on the "Print" button will print a screenshot of the plot
together with the legend on one of system printers. The "Print" button
opens a system-specific Print dialog (see example below) where the user
can select the printer, the paper size, orientation, the scaling and
the number of copies to be printed. The quality of printed image will
be the higher the higher is the display resolution. <br>
</p>

<p><img style="width: 464px; height: 419px;" alt="Print Dialog (on Windows 7)" src="GraphicsPrintDialogWin7.png"><br>
</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p>The "Save Image" button opens a file selection dialog (see below) to
define a file where the plot
area will be saved in one of image graphic formats. Currently, PDF, SVG
and PS formats are supported vor vector graphics; PNG, JPG, TIF, BMP
and other formats for bitmap graphics can also be selected. If the plot
is saved in a vector graphics format (e.g. SVG) then the image will
have professional quality and can be edited later on using commercial
software such as Adobe Illustrator. The quality of image saved in
bitmap format (e.g. PNG) will be the better the higher is the screen
resolution. <br>
