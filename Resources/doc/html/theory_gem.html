<h2><a name="CONVEX_PROG"></a>1. The convex programming approach to
chemical equilibria </h2>

<p> GEM-Selektor is an implementation of a convex programming approach
to
Gibbs energy minimization calculations of chemical equilibria ([<a href="g_litref.html#%5B1981KAR%5D">1981KAR</a>]; [<a href="g_litref.html#%5B1997KAR/CHU%5D">1997KAR/CHU</a>]; [<a href="g_litref.html#%5B2000KUL%5D">2000KUL</a>]; [<a href="g_litref.html#%5B2001KAR/CHU%5D">2001KAR/CHU</a>]; [<a href="g_litref.html#%5B2002KUL%5D">2002KUL</a>]). In brief, <small><font size="+1"><small>this approach is an advanced numerical technique for
thermodynamic modeling of heterogeneous aquatic (geo)chemical systems,
especially
those involving metastability and dispersity of mineral phases, solid
solution - aqueous solution equilbria, and adsorption/ion exchange</small></font></small>.
More details can also be found in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">TM-44-02-06
PSI
Technical report</span> (available as pdf files in the<span style="font-family: monospace;"> /program/doc/pdf/</span>&nbsp; or
from the GEMS-PSI web page). </p>

<br>

<h2><a name="KUHN_TUCKER"></a>2. Karpov (Kuhn-Tucker) conditions,
primal and
dual GEM solutions&nbsp; &nbsp; </h2>

<p>The Convex Programming approach uses the Kuhn-Tucker conditions and
the
Duality Theorem (details in Karpov, Chudnenko and Kulik 1997, <i>Amer.J.Sci</i>.
v.297, p.767-806) to detect when a global minimum of the total Gibbs
energy function <i>G</i>(<i>x</i>) is achieved. This yields two kinds
of
results simulataneously: the primal solution vector <i>x</i>
(speciation,
mole amounts of chemical species in all stable phases) and the dual
solution
vector <i>u</i> (chemical potentials of stoichiometry units). A
detailed
description can also be found in <span style="font-weight: bold;">TM-44-02-06
PSI
Technical report</span> (available as Appendix in the pdf file in<span style="font-family: monospace;"> /program/doc/pdf/</span>&nbsp; or
from the GEMS-PSI web page). </p>

<br>

<h2><a name="IPM_ALGORITHM"></a>3. The Interior Points Method (IPM)
algorithm </h2>

<p>GEMS numerical kernel is an<b><i> Interior Points Method</i></b>
(IPM) module for non-linear minimization of total Gibbs energy of the
heterogeneous multi-phase chemical system. The IPM uses internally the
Kuhn-Tucker
conditions of <i>G</i>(<i>x</i>) minimum.&nbsp; Since GEMS-PSI version
1.94a,
this kernel comes optimized for the mass balance precision,
convergence,
and extended input data diagnostics as an<i><b> &nbsp;enhanced GEM
IPM-2
module</b></i>&nbsp; to meet the needs of the most demanding modelling
applications related to performance assessment in nuclear waste
disposal
or in aquatic geochemistry. Theoretical description with some examples
can
be found in the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> TM-44-02-06 PSI
Technical report</span> (available as&nbsp; pdf files in<span style="font-family: monospace;"> /program/doc/pdf/</span>&nbsp;
directory or from the GEMS-PSI web page). </p>

<p>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<h2><a name="ACTIVITY_COEFFICIENTS"></a>4. Calculation of activity
coefficients in non-ideal mixed phases&nbsp; </h2>

<p>On each iteration of the IPM algorithm, activity coefficients of
chemical
species in non-ideal multi-component phases must be calculated. For
some
common activity models, several built-in functions are available in
GEM-selector
code (see the&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; text-decoration: underline;">Activity-Coeffs.pdf&nbsp;</span>
manual.). If the required model
is not available as a built-in fucntion, the user can always create
his/her
own equations for activity coefficients as <a href="gmscript.html">math
scripts</a>
in <a href="gm_phase.html">Phase</a> definition records. </p>

<br>

<h2><a name="IRREVERSIBLE_PROCESS"></a>5. Simulation of irreversible
mass-transfer processes&nbsp; </h2>

<p>GEM-Selektor module "<a href="gm_proces.html">Process</a>" can
generate
and plot large sequences of chemical equilibrium states to simulate the
irreversible
chemical mass-transfer using principles of local and partial
equilibria.
&nbsp;Kinetic dependencies can also be included into Process generation
math
scripts because the GEM IPM algorithm accepts upper-and lower
restrictions
to mole amount of any chemical species in the system.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace; text-decoration: underline;">Theorkin.html
</span>&lt;under construction&gt;<br>
</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="DUAL_THERMO"></a>6. Dual-Thermodynamic calculations (under
construction)</h2>

<p>The Karpov (Kuhn-Tucker) necessary and sufficient conditions of
chemical
equilibrium lead to the dual solution of GEM &nbsp;problem and thus -
to
the so-called "Dual Thermodynamic" calculations that can be performed
when
some of computed elements of the GEM primal solution (vector x) or
their
functions (concentration, activity coefficients, activities) are
independently
known from experiments or geochemical data. For instance, from the
DualT
calculation, one can retrieve either the unknown molar Gibbs energy <i>G</i><sup>*</sup>
values for pure&nbsp; solid-solution end-members or their activity
coefficients
by modelling only equilibria in the co-existing aqueous electrolyte
phase.
If several experiments at different phase compositions are available,
then
DualT calculations also permit to find the "best" end-member
stoichiometry
and retrieve uncertainty intervals of <i>G</i><sup>*</sup> or activity
coefficient
estimates. </p>

<p>To facilitate such calculations and help the users to do it
efficiently,
the DualTh module of GEM-Selektor is now under construction. It will be
available
in GEM-Selektor v.3-PSI. </p>

<br>

<h2><a name="UNCERT_SPACE"></a>7. Uncertainty Space calculations (under
construction)</h2>

<p>In geochemical modelling, all the input data are usually treated as
deterministic,
though in reality, neither the standard molar Gibbs energy of
components
nor bulk chemical composition of the system are known precisely.
Without
a sensitivity study, geochemical modelling may potentially lead to
serious
misinterpretations or totally wrong conclusions. This motivated our
on-going
work on a new approach to geochemical modelling under uncertainty of
input
data initiated by a paper [Karpov I.K. et al., <i>Russ. Geol. Geophys.</i>
1999, v.<b>40</b>, p. 971-978]. </p>

<p>Briefly, (more in <span style="font-family: monospace; text-decoration: underline;">Theoruns.html</span>
&lt;under
construction&gt;) the new "uncetrtainty" approach combines (i) Gibbs
energy
minimization (GEM) algorithm for calcula-tion of heterogeneous chemical
equilibria
[Karpov et al., 1997; 2001]; (ii) sampling the multi-dimensional
&#8220;uncertainty
space&#8221; using a uniform probing grid; (iii) advanced statistical
analysis
based on the &#8220;decision-making&#8221; criteria adopted from the game theory.
&#8220;Sampling&#8221;
means here GEM calculations of scores to thousands equilibrium states
at
different combinations of uncertain input data, located within an
uncertainty
space made of the respective uncertainty intervals taken as
coordinates.
An advanced analysis (using statistical criteria similar to that from
games
theory and decision-making support mathematics) is needed because of a
vast
sampled output (full chemical speciation at each point) and, mainly,
because
the a priori correct phase assemblage (or experimental concentration)
may
not be the most frequent one(s) among sampled results.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

The pilot studies performed so far [Chudnenko K.V. et al., PSI Bericht
in
preparation] shows that the new simulation technique indeed reveals
well-structured&nbsp;
"uncertainty space" with features that are persistent to the
downscaling
or the enhanced-resolution sampling. The graphical analysis of those
features
appears to yield trustful results that lead to a significant reduction
of
the initial input uncertainty intervals, especially if the available
experimental
data has been used for filtering the sampled points. This, in turn,
makes
the GEM modelling results much more robust and their interpretation -
more
reliable. <br>

<br>

To facilitate GEM modelling under uncertainty and enhance modelling
productivity,
the UnSpace module of GEM-Selektor is under construction. It is
supposed
to be available in GEM-Selektor v.3-PSI. <br>
