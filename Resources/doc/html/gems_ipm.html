    <h2><a name="MULTI_INTRO"></a>1. The GEM Task (Multi) Data Structure<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The GEM Task ("Multi") data structure is dynamically allocated in
      computer memory and keeps all scalars and arrays containing input,
      work
      and output data of the GEM IPM-3 algorithm (<a href="theory_gem.html">more...</a>)
      used
      in calculation of an equilibrium state. Contents of the Multi
      structure can also be exported into GEMS3K input files and used in
      standalone coupled code calculations (<a href="gems_sys.html#MULTI_INTRO">more...</a>). In
      a standalone GEMS3K program, the Multi data structure is created
      and
      filled out by reading DCH and IPM input data files; it remains
      intact during the whole runtime of GEMS3K instance. </p>
    <p>This manual provides a short overview of the GEM algorithm and
      IPM-3
      kernel program, the main work data in the Multi structure
      accessible in
      Multi: window pages, and describes the <a href="#GEMIPM3_CONTROLS">numerical
        settings</a> that control
      the operation of the GEM IPM-3 algorithm. The output
      (equilibrium speciation etc.) data is described in detail <a href="gems_sys.html">elsewhere</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p>After the whole GEM IPM-3 algorithm sequence has converged, and
      the
      GEM-Selektor
      user has clicked
      the "Accept" button, the Multi data structure remains intact in
      the
      memory, whereas
      the CSD and GEM Task results will be automatically collected,
      compressed, and saved into a SysEq
      database record. In standalone GEMS3K program, the Multi data
      structure
      remains in memory, and the GEM Task results will be
      returned to the calling program. <br>
      <br>
      There are two main modes of operation of GEM IPM-3 kernel: the
      "automatic initial approximation" mode (AIA) and the "smart
      initial
      approximation mode" (SIA). The operation mode can be set in
      GEM-Selektor Single System dialog (menu "Calculate"), as well as
      in
      Process and GEM2MT
      wizards. In GEMS3K, it can be set before every call of GEM
      calculation.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The AIA mode always uses the LP simplex procedure to get initial
      approximation of the GEM primal solution. In this mode, the MBR
      and IPM
      algorithms
      do more iterations, but require no a priori information about the
      stable phase assemblage and equilibrium speciation in the system.
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      The SIA mode needs a previous GEM task solution for the same setup
      of
      chemical system because it avoids the LP simplex step. In most
      cases,
      GEM IPM converges rapidly in this mode with a 10-20 times gain in
      computation speed. However, there is no
      guarantee that the previous GEM task result is a good initial
      approximation for a system with changed bulk composition,
      temperature,
      pressure, or metastability constraints. There is no universal
      criterion
      to check this before performing the whole GEM IPM
      calculation; at every step, it may turn out that the initial
      approximation was bad, leading to inconsistent results or to
      divergence
      in IPM or MBR numerical algorithm. At any such error condition,
      the
      program will automatically switch to the AIA mode
      for this task only. If the mode was
      already AIA, the GEM IPM calculation is stopped and an error
      message is
      generated (<a href="#GEMIPM3_ERRORS">more...</a>).

    <h2><a name="MULTI_GEMIPM3"></a> 2. The GEM Algorithm and IPM-3
      Kernel
      Program<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The operation of GEM IPM-3 module proceeds in four (AIA mode) or
      three (SIA mode) main stages, as shown on the flow chart below 
(from Kulik D.A., Wagner T., Dmytrieva S.V., Kosakowski G., Hingerl
F.F., Chudnenko K.V., Berner U. (2012): GEM-Selektor geochemical
modeling package: Numerical kernel GEMS3K for coupled simulation codes.
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Computational Geosciences</span>
(in press), <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10596-012-9310-6" target="_blank">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10596-012-9310-6</a>).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>To start calculations, the Multi data structure must be correctly
      filled out with input data (<a href="gems_bcc.html">BCC etc.</a>),
      including a feasible initial approximation (FIA) of the GEM primal
      solution.&nbsp; FIA is the speciation (amounts of Dependent
      Components)
      that is compatible with the equilibrium phase assemblage, mass
      balance
      and metastability constraints and is close enough to the Gibbs
      energy
      minimum so that the IPM algorithm can reach it and not another
      (local)
      minimum in a strongly non-ideal system. If FIA is available e.g.
      from a
      previously computed equilibrium state in a similar system, the AIA
      procedure can be skipped and calculation proceeds in "Smart
      Initial
      Approximation" (SIA) mode. Otherwise, the IPM-3 algorithm begins
      from
      the AIA procedure in the "cold-start" Automatic Initial
      Approximation
      (AIA) mode. &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
    <br>
    <p><img style="width: 640px; height: 780px;" alt="FlowChartOfIPM-3-Algorithm.png" src="FlowChartOfIPM-3-Algorithm.png"><br>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="PROCEDURE_AIA"></a>Stage 1: AIA Procedure<br>
    </h3>
    <p>An automatic initial approximation (AIA) must be used in all
      cases
      when the stable phase assemblage or the redox state is going to be
      (very) different from the previously computed equilibrium state,
      or if
      the latter is not available. In the generic non-linear GEM problem
      is
      first truncated into a LP (linear programming) subproblem<br>
      by cutting off the concentration and activity coefficient terms in
      chemical potential expressions for all dependent components. In
      this
      case, each dependent component (species) is treated as a separate
      pure
      phase. This LP sub-problem is then solved using a modified simplex
      algorithm with two-side (metastability) constraints. There are two
      controls - <a href="gems_ipm.html#Pa_EPS_0"><tt>Pa_EPS[0]</tt></a>
      and <tt><a href="gems_ipm.html#Pa_GAN_1">Pa_GAN[1]</a></tt>
      - that influence the precision
      and the result of the Simplex calculation, respectively.</p>
    <p>The GEM calculation is completed at this point, if no solution
      phases (having two or more dependent components) are present in
      the
      chemical system definition. Otherwise, the original non-linear GEM
      problem is restored, and the "Fill-out" step is applied. This step
      ensures that no thermodynamically stable phases and species will
      not be
      eliminated from the final GEM result, even though their amounts
      were
      set to zeros after simplex LP calculation. The program goes
      through the
      whole primal solution approximation vector and checks each element
      against the respective <a href="#Pa_DFY_0">Pa_DFY</a> value. If
      the
      data element contains a value equal or greater than Pa_DFY then it
      remains unchanged; otherwise the Pa_DFY value is inserted. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Note that this Fill-out procedure makes the mass balance
      precision
      worse and its improvement within the MBR procedure mandatory. Too
      large
      insertion constants in Pa_DFY can result in MBR algorithm failure,
      whereas some DCs can be lost upon GEM IPM descent iterations after
      too
      small fill-out insertions. &nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="PROCEDURE_MBR"></a>Stage 2: MBR Procedure<br>
    </h3>
    <p>In order to obtain a FIA before starting the main IPM descent
      loop,
      the mass balance precision must be checked and improved, if
      necessary
      (especially in the AIA mode). This is done within the MBR (Mass
      Balance
      Refinement) procedure that iteratively adjusts some DC amounts in
      such
      a way that the approximation remains in the feasible domain, until
      any
      mass balance residual for <span style="font-style: italic;">i</span>-th
IC
does
      not exceed a small value <span style="font-style: italic;">b<sub>i</sub></span>*
      Pa_DHB.
      The MBR algorithm tries first to adjust larger amounts of DCs,
      if possible. MBR iterations are sensitive to several tolerances -
      <tt><a href="#Pa_DHB">Pa_DHB</a>,<a href="#Pa_DFY_0"> Pa_DFY</a>,
        <a href="#Pa_DPV_0">Pa_DPV</a></tt> - which
      also define the final precision of
      GEM IPM
      results.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><a name="PROCEDURE_IPM"></a>Stage 3: GEM IPM Descent Procedure</h3>
    <p>After successful convergence of MBR, The Main IPM Descent
      procedure
      iteratively adjusts both the primal and the dual solution vectors,
      while trying to decrease the total Gibbs energy function of the
      system
      GX. At each iteration, first the descent-direction vector is
      obtained,
      then the optimal step length is estimated, and finally the primal
      solution approximation is corrected by adding products of descent
      direction (gradient) and step length for each DC. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Optionally, after each IPM iteration, the dual solution
      approximation (vector <span style="font-style: italic;">u</span>)
      can
      be checked for divergence (as controlled by <a style="font-family: monospace;" href="#Pa_LLG">Pa_LLG</a>
      tolerance).
      This check actually compares how chemical potentials of ICs vary
      between IPM iterations. In well-posed chemical systems, such
      variations
      occur rather monotonously, whereas in an ill-defined system (e.g.
      with
      respect to redox state), some chemical potentials may change
      erratically because there is not enough internal constraints to
      fix
      them. In this case, the Divergence Detector issues a warning;
      further
      IPM iterations will not improve but worsen the GEM task results. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The minimization problem is considered as solved, when
      the calculated value of the Dikin convergence criterion CD becomes
      smaller than the <a href="#Pa_DK"><tt>Pa_DK</tt></a> tolerance,
      and
      the
      maximum allowed total number of IPM iterations <a href="#Pa_IIM"><tt>Pa_IIM</tt></a>
      is not yet exceeded. At each IPM iteration, the
      CalculateActivityCoefficients() subroutine is called to update DC
      activity coefficients (and optionally electrostatic terms) in
      multi-component phases. This calculation&nbsp; is controlled by <tt><a href="#Pa_AG">Pa_AG</a>, <a href="#Pa_DGC">Pa_DGC</a>, <a href="#Pa_PRD_0">Pa_PRD</a></tt> settings.
      In the course of IPM iterations, some phases and components can be
      eliminated (zeroed-off), if their quantities become smaller than
      the
      respective
      tolerances in <a href="#Pa_DS"><tt>Pa_DS</tt></a> and <a href="#Pa_XMI_0"><tt>Pa_XMI</tt></a> fields. Changing these
      tolerances
      beyond recommended limits can strongly affect IPM convergence and
      precision of GEM IPM calculation results. <br>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="PROCEDURE_PSSC"></a>Stage 4: Phase Selection Procedure<br>
    </h3>
    <p>After convergence of the Main IPM descent, the control goes to
      the PSSC (Phase Selection and Speciation Cleanup) procedure that
      calculates stability
      criteria for all species and phases, and
      checks whether some phases have been lost from the x and
      Xa vectors and must be restored. If this was the case, the control
      will
      go back to <a href="#PROCEDURE_MBR">MBR Procedure</a>; the whole
      loop
      can be repeated up to up
      to five times. Behavior of the PSSC() algorithm mainly depends on
      the <a href="#Pa_PC"><tt>Pa_PC</tt></a> and <a href="#Pa_DF_0"><tt>Pa_DF</tt></a>
      controls. <br>
    </p>
    <p>In addition, the mass balance precision of the
      GEM IPM result is analyzed using the <tt><a href="#Pa_DHB">Pa_DHB</a>,
        <a href="#Pa_GAN_0">Pa_GAN</a>, <a href="#Pa_DPV_0">Pa_DPV</a></tt>
      controls. For each multi-component phase present in non-zero
      amount,
      the amount of each DC with trivial metastability constraints is
      checked
      for consistency with dual solution (see <a style="font-family:
        monospace;" href="#Pa_GAN_2">Pa_GAN[2]</a> and <a style="font-family: monospace;" href="#Pa_PRD_1">Pa_PRD[1]</a>
      tolerances). If an inconsistency is found, it will be corrected
      and, if
      the correction is too strong, the control goes to <a href="#PROCEDURE_MBR">MBR Procedure</a> again.</p>

    <p>This page consists of two tables. The upper table presents some
      data
      for Independent Components: their names and types (<a href="gems_sys.html#ICnam">ICnam</a>), atomic/molar masses (<a href="gems_sys.html#icM">icM</a>), the input bulk composition of
      the
      system (<a href="gems_sys.html#b">b</a>), the mass balance
      deviations.
      Three columns that follow (<a href="gems_sys.html#u">u</a>, <a href="gems_sys.html#uc">uc</a>[0], uc[1]) represent the dual
      solution
      values (Lagrange multipliers) from this and two earlier IPM
      iterations.
      The <a href="gems_sys.html#uefd">uefd</a> column contains
      Lagrange
      multipliers for the Mass Balance Refinement (MBR) task.</p>
    <p>The lower table begins with coefficients of the stoichiometry
      matrix
      <a href="gems_sys.html#A">A</a> (rows for DCs/species, columns for
      ICs), followed by the DC names list (<a href="gems_sys.html#DCnam">DCnam</a>),
the
primal
      GEM solution vector (<a href="gems_sys.html#x">x</a>), the
      standard Gibbs energy functions of DCs (<a href="gems_sys.html#g0">g0</a>),
as
well
      as molar masses of DCs (<a href="gems_sys.html#mmDC">mmDC</a>)
      and molar volumes of DCs (<a href="gems_sys.html#vol">vol</a>). <br>
    </p>
    <p>Taken together, these two tables represent most of the GEM Task
      setup input and relevant output data. The A table can be used for
      checking DC stoichiometries, as well as mass balance (together
      with the
      x vector). The three consecutive approximations of the dual
      solution u
      (upper table) can be useful to see where the dual solution
      diverges in
      the case of warnings, and how chemical potential approximations
      for ICs
      change between IPM iterations.&nbsp; <br>

      GEM
      IPM-3 Kernel
      Operation</h2>
    <p> The data objects listed below control the operation of GEM
      IPM-3 kernel program. They are saved in the modelling
      project database record and can be changed any time in the
      "Equilibria
      Calculation" mode upon opening the Project window and editing its
      <a href="gm_project.html#MWPAGE_2">"Controls" page</a>.&nbsp; If
      you
      will&nbsp;
      change any field there, but not save the Project record, then your
      changes will apply only until the project session is closed; after
      that, the changes
      will be lost. To make the changes persistent, save the Project
      record to database by clicking on the "Save" toolbar button (or
      "Record" "Save" menu command). <br>
    </p>
    <p>For the standalone GEMS3K program, the numerical settings are
      exported as part of the IPM
      input file and can be edited there, if necessary. They remain
      valid
      for the whole duration of GEMS3K instance in computer memory. Only
      numerical settings that differ from defaults may be exported to
      IPM
      file (<a href="#WRITEIPMFILES">more ...</a>). <br>
    </p>
    <p>Note that usually, there is no need to change default numerical
      settings. The default values below
      correspond to aqueous systems of 1000 total moles
      of independent components in the internal Multi <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span> vector; re-scaling from-to
      actual
      BCC occurs automatically within the IPM-3 kernel program. Ad-hoc
      changes of the IPM-3 numerical
      controls, especially setting
      them beyond the indicated validity intervals, may
      cause the program to crash, freeze, or produce meaningless
      results. However, some controls must be adjusted for certain types
      of
      systems.<b> <br>

      <dd> In certain chemical systems, some
        chemical potentials are not well constrained by physically
        significant amounts
        of relevant chemical species. This leads to indefinite values of
        some IC chemical potentials in the dual solution vector <a href="gems_sys.html#u">u</a> and numerically stiff behavior in
        GEM IPM iterations. The resulting IPM solution may strongly
        depend on the chosen
        values of numerical tolerances and on the parameters of
        smoothing (<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">more...</span>).
        Therefore, early detection of such divergence saves time and
        helps identify problems with the setup or composition of the
        system. The detection is performed within the Check-uDD
        algorithm, starting from 2nd IPM Main Descent iteration. The
        Check_uDD procedure actually monitors how strongly chemical
        potentials of ICs change between IPM iterations (<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">more...</span>) by means of
        calculating moving averages of u<sub>i</sub> values over 3 IPM

      <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>
      <dd>In some highly non-ideal systems, the IPM convergence may not
        be achieved due to rather strong dependence of excess part of DC
        chemical potentials on the phase composition. Therefore,
        smoothing of the excess part (composed from ln(gamma) terms) may
        be necessary before adding it to the primal chemical potential.
        In GEM-Selektor, three smoothing functions are available. <br>
      </dd>
      <dd>One smoothing function uses the logarithmic distance between
        the
        current index of IPM
        iteration IT and the maximum allowed number of iterations IIM in
        <a href="#Pa_IIM"><big><span style="font-family: monospace;">Pa_IIM</span></big></a>.
        This function
        has the form <br>
      </dd>
      <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SF= DGC + ( AG -
        DGC ) / ( 1. + exp( log(1/IIM) - log(1/IT ) /
        DGC ) + exp( log( 1. - AG ) + log(1/IT) ). <br>
      </dd>
      <dd>This function will be invoked when Pa_AG &lt;= -0.0001 and
        Pa_DGC &gt;
        -0.0001 (internally, the sign of AG is inverted to positive).
        The SF
        (smoothing factor) value will be truncated to 1.0 if it exceeds
        1.0.
        Example: set Pa_AG to -1 and Pa_DGC to 0.7. <br>
      </dd>
      <dd>Another smoothing function uses the logarithmic distance
        between the current Dikin criterion CD (<a href="gems_sys.html#Psi_DK_0">Psi_DK[0]</a>) and the
        convergence
        threshold given in <a href="#Pa_DK"><big><span style="font-family: monospace;">Pa_DK</span></big></a>.</dd>
      <dd>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; SF = DGC + ( AG - DGC ) / ( 1. +
        exp( log(DK) - log(CD) ) / DGC )
        + exp( log( 1. - AG ) + log(CD) ).</dd>
      <dd>The SF value will be truncated to 1.0 if it exceeds 1.0. This
        function is invoked when both Pa_AG and Pa_DGK are set less than
        -0.0001 (internally, both will have the sign inverted to
        positive).
        Example: set Pa_AG to -1 and Pa_DGC to -0.7; this gives very
        good
        convergence of IPM in systems containing&nbsp; highly non-ideal
        solid
        solutions, even without global IPM refinement loops (see <a href="#Pa_PRD_1"><span style="font-family: monospace;">Pa_PRD[1]</span></a>).



        <br>
      </dd>
      <dd>For both functions, Pa_AG should usually be set to
        -1.0. If |AG| is set less than 1.0 then the smoothing will
        effectively begin
        after
        several IPM iterations.</dd>
      <dd>The third (old) smoothing function is retained mainly for
        surface complexation models with Langmuir-type surface activity
        coefficient terms. It has the form&nbsp; <br>
      </dd>
      <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SF = AG * ( 1 -
        pow(1-exp(-DGC*IT),60)). <br>
      </dd>
      <dd>If SF &lt; 1e-6 then SF is set to 1e-6.&nbsp; After ca. 50th
        iteration, the value of smoothing factor SF will be decreased
        down to 1e-6 more or less steep upon iterations, depending on
        the Pa_DGC value. This function is chosen when 0.0001 &lt; Pa_AG
        &lt; 0.9999 and 0.0001 &lt; Pa_DGC &lt; 0.1. Typical setting for
        adsorption models: Pa_AG = 0.7 and Pa_DGC = 0.07. <br>

      <li>Some relevant phases or DCs are missing from chemical system

      <li>Some metastability constraints on DC are inconsistent</li>
      <li>Some numerical thresholds or tolerances are too tight</li>

    <h2><a name="TO_STANDALONE"></a>6. Connection with Standalone GEMS3K
      Program (and Coupled Codes)<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The GEMS3K code (<a href="gems3k-about.html">more ...</a>) is a
      numerical kernel module extracted from the GEM-Selektor code
      package for Gibbs energy minimization (GEM) and enhanced with the
      memory- and file-system- data exchange interfaces without GUI
      (Graphical User's Interface). GEMS3K is
      designed for
      coupling the GEM chemical solver with
      the existing and new reactive mass transport (RMT)
      codes on the basis of the "operator-splitting" approach (more in <a href="gems3k-manual.html">GEMS3K documentation</a>). The idea
      behind GEMS3K was to keep the code implementation and handling of
      input/output data as simple as possible, which is the prerequisite
      for compiling the coupled RMT-GEM program on any computer
      architecture, up to parallel HPC clusters. Consequently, the
      GEMS3K program has no GUI and no direct access to thermodynamic
      data base records and calculations; thermodynamic data for a range
      of temperatures and pressures must be provided as look-up arrays
      for interpolation. GEMS3K has no script interpreter included,
      therefore only built-in activity models of multi-component phases
      from <a href="gems3k-tsolmod.html">TSolMod class library</a> can
      be used, but not those implemented in Phase scripts; usage of
      Process, GtDemo and GEM2MT scripts is also not possible.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>The input data for GEMS3K can be provided in ASCII files (also
      produced from GEM-Selektor), the output can also be written in
      ASCII files (<a href="gems3k-iofiles.html">more ...</a>) and
      alternatively into VTK format files for the subsequent
      visualization of results using external programs (e.g. ParaView,
      VisIt, etc.). At runtime, the whole data exchange with a transport
      code part can be performed in RAM using DATACH and DATABR data
      structures. This data exchange interface is implemented in two C++
      classes &#8211; TNode and TNodeArray. The TNode class provides
      functionality for attaching GEMS3K kernel to an existing transport
      model code which keeps the chemical information for all nodes and
      calls GEM calculation for each node separately.<br>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;As no GUI is available in standalone or coupled GEMS3K
      code, the only way to exchange input and output data with the GEM
      IPM kernel is by using the TNode class functions that use DATACH
      and DATABR structures, either in computer memory (<a href="gems3k-useref.html">more ...</a>), or by reading/writing
      the DCH, IPM and DBR input files (<a href="gems3k-iofiles.html">more
        ...</a>). These files contain the whole GEM task and, in
      principle, can be prepared "by hand" with help of a simple text
      editor. <br>
    </p>
    <p>However, a really efficient way is to export the GEMS3K input
      files from GEM-Selektor, as described below.&nbsp; This can save a
      lot of work time, especially when
      the coupled
      modeling must be performed at temperatures and pressures varying
      from
      node to
      node or over time. This is more than just technical issue: it is
      essential to
      investigate the behavior and stiffness of the chemical system in
      detail
      (by
      performing GEMS runs up to the simulation of irreversible mixing,
      oxidation/reduction, or titration) before inserting it into the
      coupled
      reactive transport model, calculation of which is far more
      expensive.</p>

How
to
      Write and Read GEMS3K I/O Files
      From the Single System Dialog</h3>
    <p>This method produces one DCH, one IPM and one DBR file for a
      given single chemical system definition and GEM task. How to read
      these files in is <a href="#HOWTO_READ_IN">described here</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In the Single System dialog, calculate and save the desired SysEq
      record. Then click on "Data" "Export GEMS3K files..." menu
      command. This opens the "Setup for writing GEMS3K input files"
      dialog, which by default looks like this:</p>
    <br>
    <img style=" width: 576px; height: 569px;" alt="SetupWritingGEMS3KfilesDialog.png" src="SetupWritingGEMS3KfilesDialog.png"><br>
    <br>
    <p>In the upper group, you have a choice to write GEMS3K files in
      text mode (default) or in binary mode. Activating the "Do not
      write data items that contain only default values" will result in
      much smaller IPM and DBR files because only data and numerical
      settings that differ from default values will be written; by
      reading these files, GEMS3K will assume default values for all
      data objects that are not present in the input files. Note that
      this makes sense to do if you are sure that you work with the same
      GEMS3K version in both GEM-Selektor and the coupled code. The next
      option ("Write files with comments..."), if deactivated, results
      in much more compact though less human-readable text input files.
      The last option ("Include node transport properties into DBR
      file") should be unchecked (default) when exporting files for
      coupled codes such as OGS-GEMS where all such information is kept
      in the transport part of the code. The topmost option "Select ICs,
      DCs, and phases to be exchanged via DATABR file...",&nbsp; if
      activated, can be used for setting up very compact DBR files that
      only contain items that will change in standalone or coupled
      calculations (<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">yet untested;
        more about this here ...</span>); normally, just leave it
      unchecked (default). &nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>The middle group can be used to set up the lookup arrays with
      thermodynamic data (to be written at the end of the DCH file).
      This group consists of two iterators - one for pressure and one
      for temperature. In the simplest case such as shown above, the
      data will be calculated for one pressure and one temperature,
      which are taken over from the current GEM task. <br>
    </p>
    <p>However, if coupled-code calculations will be performed with
      variable temperature and pressure, a look-up array must be
      exported. In this case, the user must specify wide enough pressure
      and temperature intervals (in Min. and Max. fields on both sides)
      and the step values such that at least 10 grid points will be
      created for pressure and 10 to 40 grid points for temperature (or
      less to keep the temperature step greater than 3 - 5 degrees). The
      "Tolerance" fields define the area around grid points where
      interpolation will not be done and values corresponding to the
      grid point will be extracted directly, if T and P fall within
      tolerances at this point.</p>
    <p>The lower group settings let the user to fine-tune the setup of
      look-up arrays and their T,P grid values after the pressure and
      temperature iterators have been set up. <br>
    </p>
    <p> If the checkbox "Enter pressure and temperature values" is
      activated, a next page of the dialog will appear showing values of
      pressure and temperature, automatically generated from P and T
      iterators using the interval and step size set there. If
      necessary, these values of P and T can be modified by the user,
      then the program will use them to construct and export the look-up
      array data. This occurs differently, depending on the "Disable
      Interpolation" checkbox state. <br>
    </p>
    <p>If this checkbox is not checked (default), the usual P,T grid
      consisting of nP*nT (P,T) points will be generated, and
      interpolation will be enabled in the whole P and T intervals
      space. The number nP of pressure grid points can be different from
      the number nT of temperature grid points. <br>
    </p>
    <p>However, if the "Disable Interpolation" checkbox is checked, nT
      will be set equal to nP, and only nP (P,T) pairs will be used as a
      grid to generate and export the look-up arrays of thermodynamic
      data; the interpolation will be disabled, so GEMS3K calculations
      shall be done only at (T,P) pair values given in the grid table
      (to be seen in the next wizard page) within tolerances given under
      P and T iterators. <br>
    </p>
    <p>If different number of P and/or T points (greater than 1) was set
      by the user, the P and T values will be automatically generated
      using&nbsp; these given nP (nT), Min. and Step values from the
      iterators, again with the possibility for the user to modify
      values in the second page of this dialog. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>The "Next" button proceeds either to the next page (if "Enter
      pressure ..." checkbox is activated), or directly to the standard
      dialog where the path to the folder where the generated input
      GEMS3K files will be saved.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If the "Enter pressure ..." checkbox is activated and the
      "Disable Interpolation" checkbox is not activated, the second page
      will look like that shown below.&nbsp; In this example, the
      Pressure iterator on the first page has been set to 1 bar start,
      91 bar end value, and 10 bar step; the Temperature iterator has
      been set to 5 C start, 95 C end value, and 5 degrees step. The
      user can now enter other numbers, if necessary, for instance,
      change pressure to 1; 10; 20; 30; ... bar; or some P and T values
      adjusted to allow more precise interpolation around some important
      phase transitions. The lookup grid will have 190 (T,P) points,
      among which the interpolation in P,T space takes place. <br>
    </p>
    <br>

    </p>
    <br>
    <p>If both the "Enter pressure ..." checkbox and the "Disable
      Interpolation" checkbox are activated, the second page for the
      previous example will take the following shape: <br>

    <br>
    <p>In this case, the number of (T,P) pairs was determined from the
      Pressure iterator and applied to the whole interval given in the
      Temperature iterator, which yields 10 (T,P) pairs. The values can
      be edited now, if necessary, e.g. in accordance with experimental
      (T,P) data; the GEMS3K program will not perform interpolation,
      which means that only calculations at 10 given (T,P) pair values
      will be possible, as well as at slightly different T,P values
      within tolerances for each grid point. The look-up arrays will
      contain data for 10 (T,P) pair values, not for 100 (T,P) points as
      it would be in the case when the interpolation is allowed.&nbsp; <br>

    <h3><a name="HOWTO_READ_IN"></a>How to read GEMS3K I/O files with
      standalone calculation results into a SysEq record <br>
    </h3>
    <p>When GEMS3K input files have been exported from GEM-Selektor for
      use standalone coupled-code calculations that produce DBR files
      with different composition and speciation, such files can be
      imported into GEM-Selektor to investigate these results in "Single
      System" dialog and related EqDemo: and Multi: submodule windows.
      The files can be imported (read in) only in that modeling project
      where they have been originally exported from. <br>
    </p>
    <p>To import GEMS3K files, arrange them in any folder in the same
      way as if they would be exported: one IPM, one DCH and one DBR
      file, with file names listed in the respective .lst file. For
      example, the initial GEMS3K files were exported from the SysEq
      record "Carbonates:G:IsoCaCdDol:0:0:10:75:0:" into a file set
      consisting of files&nbsp; "IsoCaCdDol-ipm.dat",
      "IsoCaCdDol-dch.dat", "IsoCaCdDol-dbr-0-0000.dat", and
      "IsoCaCdDol-dat.lst". The latter file lists the previous three
      files as <br>
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace;">-t "IsoCaCdDol-dch.dat"
      "IsoCaCdDol-ipm.dat"&nbsp; "IsoCaCdDol-dbr-0-0000.dat"</p>
    <p>(this means that all four files must be in the same folder; -t
      tells that the files are in text format). The key of the exported
      SysEq record can be found at the beginning of the
      "IsoCaCdDol-ipm.dat" file. In standalone calculations, the DCH and
      IPM files will not be changed, only
      the new DBR files will be generated. To import one of those (e.g.
      "IsoCaCdDol-dbr-result-00001.dat"), it has to be placed in the
      same folder where DCH and IPM files reside, and its name must be
      entered into the .lst file, for instance, called
      "IsoCaCdDol-dat-to-import.lst" with contents</p>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace;">-t "IsoCaCdDol-dch.dat"
        "IsoCaCdDol-ipm.dat"&nbsp; "IsoCaCdDol-dbr-result-00001.dat"</span>&nbsp;
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>When a folder with the set of GEMS3K files is ready, proceed as
      follows. Start GEM-Selektor and go in "Equilibria Calculation"
      mode, select and open the appropriate project ("Carbonates" in
      this example).&nbsp; In "Single System" dialog, execute the "Data"
      "Import GEMS3K DBR file..." menu command. <br>
    </p>
    <p>In the appearing "Browse for GEMS3K *.lst file to import" dialog,
      find in the folder and select the necessary .lst file
      ("IsoCaCdDol-dat-to-import.lst" in this example), and click
      "Open".&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>You should see now the "Enter record key" dialog with fields
      corresponding to SysEq record key from the imported IPM file. Edit
      fields as you like, to make sure that no such SysEq record already
      exists in the project, and click Ok. The program reads GEMS3K
      files, and replaces the previous recipe by the bulk composition
      from DBR file taken over into the bi_ data object (input mole
      amounts of Independent Components),&nbsp; as well as metastability
      constraints and selection of components from the imported IPM and
      DCH files. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
    <p>In the appearing "Input Recipe" dialog, you should see now the
      bulk system composition from the imported DBR file, given as bi_
      values. Click "Ok" to proceed.&nbsp; Now, click "Open EqDemo
      window..." toolbar button to explore the imported contents of the
      GEM task data structure just as they were computed by the
      standalone program, without being re-calculated in GEM-Selektor.
      You can save the SysEq record with these imported contents.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>You can also re-calculate the imported equilibrium state to see
      if there is any difference, e.g. by differences in interpolated
      and directly calculated thermodynamic data. These differences (if
      any) can be seen in the gEx column in MTparm (Thermodynamic data)
      window. To re-calculate, it is the best to clone the imported
      SysEq record and re-run GEM, then the data from originally
      imported and re-computed equilibria can be copy-pasted to a
      spreadsheet and compared there. &nbsp; </p>
