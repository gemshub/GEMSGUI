<h2>Automatic Setup of Aqueous and Gas/Fluid Phases</h2>


<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2> </h2>



<p>This dialog facilitates definition of the aqueous
electrolyte
phase and/or the gas/fluid mixture phase that are automatically
assembled upon opening or creating a GEMS3 modelling project. 
Alternatively, a Phase record already available in the project database 
can be selected,
 or the aqueous phase (or gas/fluid mixture) can be excluded from the 
template chemical system definition in this modeling project. </p>





<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The first tab "Select Aqueous Electrolyte Model"</span> lets you define a
built-in
function for calculating activity coefficients of individual aqueous
species.
These can be selected by clicking on radio buttons on the left-hand side. The two last
choices
should be used when none of the built-in functions is applicable, or no
aqueous
phase should be included into the chemical system definition. In the
"Parameters for the aqueous model"
frame, you can change some default parameters used in some of the
built-in
aqueous activity functions that are described below.</p>





<p>Most aqueous activity coefficient models that are currently
supported by the GEMS3 code belong to extended
Debye-Hückel (EDH) models (see document "/Resources/doc/pdf/Activity-Coeffs.pdf" for
details  and references). In these models,
the extended term (b_gamma) can be a function of pressure and
temperature or a constant value. In the drop-down list "b_gamma(P,T) mode",
the operation mode of the b_gamma function can be selected. If
the mode "constant" is chosen, the value of b_gamma at reference state
conditions (25 <sup>o</sup>C, 1 bar) needs to be selected in the
"b_gamma(1,298) value" drop-down list, or another value be entered there.</p>





<p>Alternatively, for calculations at hydrothermal conditions, the
    b_gamma term can be a function of temperature and pressure. In this
case, one of four built-in b_gamma
 functions for different so-called background
electrolytes (NaCl, KCl, NaOH, KOH) can be selected. The concept of the
background electrolyte means an assumption that the aqueous
solution is dominantly composed of that particular
electrolyte, so the model should be chosen accordingly. For instance, if
 in your
project you mainly deal with NaCl-rich fluids (the most common case) or 
with seawater, choose the NaCl variant; for cementitious systems, the 
KOH variant can be chosen. </p>


  


<p>Note that for internal
thermodynamic consistency, T-P-dependent b_gamma
functions should be used in conjunction with the extended
Debye-Hückel model after <a href="#HELGESON_REFS">Helgeson and coworkers</a>,
i.e. the second
model in this tab, which has the code "H". If a T-P dependent b_gamma
model is
selected, there is no need to enter a number into the "b_gamma(1,298)
value" field because this value is automatically calculated by a
built-in routine. However, it is still necessary to set the appropriate
value of the ion size parameter a0 for each of the four background
electrolytes. The value of a0 (also called "distance
of closest approach") is selected from the drop-down list "Common a0
value" (or entered there). The recommended a0 values for the four
background
electrolytes are:</p>

<p>From the Debye-Hueckel models described above, the activity coefficients
of aqueous electrolyte species (charged ions and complexes) will be
calculated. For uncharged species (neutral ion pairs and complexes,
neutral dissolved gas molecules such as CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S
etc.) and for water solvent, different activity coefficient model 
options can
be used. Four combinations exist, which can be specified using the 
"Gamma (neutral species)" and "Gamma (water solvent)" drop-down lists. 
In the former, the activity coefficient of any neutral aqueous species 
can be either set to unity or calculated as b_gamma * IS;
 in the latter, the activity coefficient of water-solvent can be set to 
unity or computed from the osmotic coefficient by the built-in routine.



</p>
<p>Note that the 
basic model should be selected (by clicking the appropriate
radio button on the left side of the tab) before setting up details of 
calculation modes and parameters (T-P-dependence of parameters,
calculation of activity coefficients for neutral species and water
solvent) on the right side of the tab. Because of thermodynamic 
consistency, options that explicitly calculate the activity coefficient 
of
water solvent
should only be used with the extended Debye-Hückel model after
  <a href="#HELGESON_REFS">Helgeson and coworkers</a>.



</p>
<p>Clicking on the "Check" button displays a record key of the <a href="gm_phase.html">Phase record</a> to be automatically generated; the
chosen model and its parameters will be identified in the <a style="font-family: monospace;" href="gm_phase.html#PhName">PhName</a> and <a style="font-family: monospace;" href="gm_phase.html#PhNote">PhNote</a> fields of the record key. You can
check
them later when you open the "Phase" page of the "System" window from
the
"Single Thermodynamic System" dialog, mark the aqueous phase record key, and
press
F7 keyboard key. Note that, before the same modelling project is
opened
next time, this Phase definition record will be automatically deleted
and
generated again without displaying this setup dialog.


</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The second tab "Select Gas/Fluid Mixture Model"</span> defines the
automatically
generated Phase record for the gas or fluid mixture. It functions in a way
similar
to that for the aqueous phase. The generic models that are currently
supported are:</p>
<ol>
  <li> ideal gas mixture of ideal gases (I); </li>
  <li>non-ideal gas (fluid)
mixture calculated with the Churakov-Gottschalk (CG) model (F); </li>
  <li>non-ideal gas (fluid)
mixture calculated with the Peng-Robinson (PR) model (7);&nbsp; </li>
  <li>non-ideal gas (fluid)
mixture calculated with the Peng-Robinson-Stryjek-Vera (PRSV) model (P); </li>
  <li>non-ideal gas (fluid)
mixture calculated with the Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) model (E). </li>
</ol>
<p>See document "/Resources/doc/pdf/Activity-Coeffs.pdf" for
details and references. Other automatic models may be added in future
versions. Note that interaction parameters of mixing between fluid
components cannot be entered into the atomatic fluid phase; instead, a
user-prepared Phase record must be selected. <br>
</p>
<p>The use of automatically generated definition of an ideal mixture of ideal gases ('I', default) implies that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>DComp records for gases with keys starting with <span style="font-family: monospace;">'g'</span> (gaseous) phase state code are available in the project database;</li>
  <li>All such records will be taken into one automatically generated Phase record with key beginning with 'g'.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The use of the 
automatically generated definition of a non-ideal gas/fluid mixture implies that: <br>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>consistent parameters such as <a href="gm_dcomp.html#CritPg"><span style="font-family: monospace;">CritPg</span></a> vector are provided in <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a> records available in the 
project database;<br>
 </li>
  <li>these DComp record keys start with the <span style="font-family: monospace;">'f'</span> (fluid) phase state code instead of <span style="font-family: monospace;">'g'</span> (gaseous) phase state code;</li>
  <li>All such records will be taken into one automatically generated Phase record with key beginning with 'f'.<br>
  </li>

</ul>
<p>No additional options for
the gas/fluid
mixture (right-hand side of the wizard tab) are available in this version of
GEM-Selektor.



</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Any "specific interaction" non-ideal model</span> of aqueous electrolyte or gas (fluid)
mixture cannot be composed in the automatic mode and must be previosly created (prepared by the user) in
GEMS3 Database Mode as a specific <a href="gm_phase.html">Phase definition record</a>. Such a definition typically contains a list of included chemical species, and an array of
interaction parameter coefficients entered into the <a style="font-family: monospace;" href="gm_phase.html#ph_cf">ph_cf</a>
 table. <br>
</p>
<p>One or more available Phase
record can be selected by choosing the option "Do not
generate; select a user-defined Phase record from database, U" (present
on both tabs). After
selecting this option, a list of suitable Phase records will be
displayed, from which one record must be selected (one or more for the
fluid/gas phases). If only one suitable record is available in the
project database, the list will not appear, and this record will be
taken automatically. By clicking the "Check" button, you can see which
record has been chosen in the "Phase record key" field.&nbsp; </p>





<p>The setup of automatically generated or selected Phase records for aqueous and
gas
phases can be changed any time only upon opening the modelling project. To
change, deactivate the "Retain setup of aqueous (and gas) phases" option in
the <a href="gm_project.html#HOWTO">"Modelling Projects" dialog</a> before
selecting an existing project to be opened. <br>
</p>
<p>An easy way to prepare a Phase definition e.g. for non-ideal fluid with specific interaction coefficients is described in the <a href="gm_phase#PHASE_GASFLUID">Phase help file</a>.<br>
