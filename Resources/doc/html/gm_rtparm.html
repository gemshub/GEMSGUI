<h2><a name="RTPARM_INTRO"></a>1. Introduction<br>
</h2>
<p>

When thermodynamic data are entered into <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a>
records, or new <a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a> definitions are
constructed, misprints and errors can be introduced. Some of them are
automatically detected in DComp / ReacDC subroutines, i.e. such errors
as incomplete or inconsistent standard state data, wrong formula
stoichiometry, incorrect species charge; the corresponding diagnostic messages
are then issued. Some other errors can be detected only when a series
of thermodynamic data for varying <i>T,P</i>&nbsp; is computed and
plotted on graphs. Thus, the RTParm screen
forms and graphics are provided for facilitating the process of "debugging"&nbsp;
thermodynamic data and their <i>T,P</i> dependencies for individual
species. The RTParm module takes the input data from DComp or ReacDC
record having a key with the same first four fields as in the <a href="gems_rekey.html#dbm_RTParm">RTParm record key</a>. Note that the <a href="gems_tdb.html#OVERRIDE">override mechanism</a> does not apply to
RTParm module operation. </p>
<p>RTParm module workflow consists of three basic steps.<br>



</p>
<p><b>Create/remake for a given DComp or ReacDC record. </b>RTParm 
Wizard appears to configure the calculations. After the wizard is 
finished, RTParm arrays will be allocated, and the 'Scripts' page 
appears. There, the user can fill out
 the RTname and RTcom comment lines; edit the math script in tExpr 
field, 
if necessary. This script will collect data from the objects visible on 
the 
TPwork page and puts it into xT, xP and yF array elements. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Calculation.</b> Clicking on 'Calculate' toolbar button runs the 
RTParm tabulator. This calculator iterates through T,P pairs as geven in
 xT and xP vectors. For each T,P, thermodynamic properties are 
calculated and put into fields seen in TPWork page, from where they are 
sampled by tExpr script into the xF table accessible in the 'Tables' 
page. On that page, the user can edit there the names of axis and plots,
 and
 click on the 'Plot data' button to see a customizable plot. <br>
</p>

<p>Plotting experimental data over calculated results is an option. To 
do this, the necessary number of experimental points and parameters per 
point must be set in RTParm wizard in beforehand. The user can type or 
paste the values into xTE, xPE and ytE arrays (appearing on Setup page),
 and even optionally re-scale them upon RTParm calculation by entering 
the script into tExprE field. 
open the plot again, and customise it, if necessary.</p>

<p>The RTParm record can always be re-configured by clicking on Remake 
toolbar button, or cloned for the same or different DComp or ReacDC 
record.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr size="2" width="100%"><h3><a name="RTPARM_MWIZARD"></a>2.
RTParm Create/Remake Wizard</h3>

<p>To create a new RTParm record, first make sure that the source DComp
or ReacDC record has already been created, calculated and saved in the
database. Then switch to the "RTParm" window and select the "Record"
"Create" menu command. <br>
</p>
<p>A small dialog will appear asking you to choose
a source data record from either DComp or ReacDC records. Press
"DComp" or "ReacDC" buttons (depending on what a source record you
actually have). This will display a list of all available record keys, where you have to mark one and press the "Ok" button. <br>
</p>
<p>Next,
you will see a "RTParm: Please, set a new record key" dialog where you 
have
to enter only the last field (shown as the asterisk), usually a 
calculation variant because more then one RTParm record can be created 
for
the same source DComp or ReacDC record. Enter "1", "2", or any small
integer you like, and press "Ok" when ready. This will bring you into 
the RTParm Wizard (see below). <br>

<hr size="2" width="100%"><h3><a name="WZSTEP_2"></a>2.2.
RTParm Wizard Step 2 - Selection of items to sample</h3>

<p>This step provides a convenient way of selecting results of RTParm calculations that should be sampled by the <a href="#tExpr">RTParm script</a> into the <a href="#yF"><tt>yF</tt></a> table (and possibly plotted), along with desired unit conversions and re-scaling. 
The sampling script will be executed for each row of yF (xT, xP) tables;
 the rows have index jTP that automatically will run from 0 to nTP-1, 
where nTP is the number of rows. Therefore, the script contains of 
assignments to elements of the yF arrays, e.g. <tt>yf[jTP][0],</tt> ... . The
 values of thermodynamic properties at T,P for a given calculation step 
jTP are accessible in data objects visible in TPwork page of RTParm 
window. <br>
</p>
<p>The 'Item Selection' list contains entries that correspond to data objects in the <a href="#MWPAGE_3">TPwork page</a>. 
Each entry shows a tooltip by hovering the cursor over it. Left click on
 the entry results in its addition to the script (with incremented 
column idex), clicking again removes the item operator from the script. <br>
</p>
<p>By right-clicking on the item, a small menu appears, where 
"Calculator" can be selected. This opens the GEMS calculator, in which 
one can select the operation and the second operand. For instance, to 
convert Joules to kiloJoules, select '/' (divide), type 1000 in the 
operand field, and click Ok. Typical result of such manipulations is 
shown in a screenshot below.<br>
</p>
<br>
<p><img alt="RTParmWizard-ItemsSelectionStep.png" src="RTParmWizard-ItemsSelectionStep.png" height="519" width="694"><br>
</p>
<br>
<p>It is not recommended to select all items for one RTParm record; you 
can always clone two or three such records for the same ReacDC or DComp.
 For instance, either the molar properties for the reaction-defined 
component (as shown above), or the properties of the reaction should be 
selected. <br>
</p>
<p>When ready, click "Next &gt;" to proceed. The script can be edited in the Scripts page later on. <br>

<hr size="2" width="100%"><h3><a name="WZSTEP_3"></a>2.3.
RTParm Wizard Step 3 - Important dimensions</h3>
<p>This wizard page provides an additional setup of dimensions for the 
data tabulation arrays. This group has three spinboxes (from top to 
bottom). <br>
</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; Number of columns in the yF table (plot curves), 1 to 10. Default: 1. 
The user should check this number, which should not be less than the 
number of operators assigning yF[jTP][0], ... values in the RTParm 
script. Add more columns if some such operators will be added later 
directly by editing the script. The number of rows (T-P pairs) in yF, 
xP, xT arrays will be set automatically.<br>
</p>

<p>(2) Optional: Number of rows in xTE, xPE, ytE arrays for experimental
 data. Default: 0 (these arrays are not provided). Set here (if any) the
 number of&nbsp; data points that should be plotted over the calculated 
curves. If this dimension is set to a positive number then another 
script editor <a href="#tExprE"><tt>tExprE</tt></a> will appear, where an optional script for re-scaling experimental values in ytE table can be entered.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>(3) Optional: Number of columns in the ytE array for experimental 
data. Default: 1. Change this if more than one number per experimental 
data point will be entered into the ytE table.<br>
</p><br>
<hr size="2" width="100%"><h3><a name="WZSTEP_4"></a>2.4.
RTParm Wizard Step 4 - Workflow suggestions</h3>
<p>Here the user can set the (optional) number of links to SDref 
bibliography records (default: 0), for instance, to the source of 
experimental data. <br>
</p>
<p>This wizard page also contains a brief description of RTParm workflow:<br>
</p>

<p>(1) RTParm arrays will be allocated; 'Scripts' page appears. Fill out
 RTname and RTcom comment lines. Edit the math script in tExpr; field, 
if necessary. This script collects data from the objects visible on the 
TPwork page and puts it into xT, xP and yF array elements. <br>
</p>
<p>'(2) Click on 'Calculate' toolbar button to run the tabulator (in 
case of error message, fix the script and try calculation again). Check 
sampled results on the 'Tables' page. Enter names of axis and plots, and
 click on the 'Plot data' button to see a customizable plot.<br>
</p>
<p>(3) To plot experimental data over calculated results, close the 
graph dialog, type or paste the values into xTE, xPE and ytE arrays, 
open the plot again, and customise it, if necessary.</p>

<hr size="2" width="100%"><h2><a name="RTPARM_MWINDOW"></a>3.
RTParm Module Window</h2>
<p>RTParm is a tool for tabulating and plotting thermodynamic data against 
temperature <i>T</i> and/or pressure <i>P</i>. The input is taken from a
 DComp or 
ReacDC record specified in this RTParm record key. Upon calculation, 
the results will be tabulated in yF table on the 'Tables' page, as 
specified in 'tExpr' 
math script. Results can be plotted, exported into text files, or 
copy-pasted to other programs. Simple 'tExpr' scripts that extract 
calculated results into the yF table can be edited on "Scripts" page. <br>


</p>

<br>



<hr size="2" width="100%"><h3><a name="MWPAGE_1"></a>3.1.
RTParm Window 'Scripts' Page</h3>
<p>This page provides access to comment lines that identify this RTParm 
calculation; the pressure and temperature iterators (usually set in the 
RTParm wizard); and the tExpr text editor field, where the RTParm script
 to sample calculated data can be modified or enhanced. <br>
</p>

<hr size="2" width="100%"><h3><a name="MWPAGE_2"></a>3.2.
RTParm Window 'Tables' Page</h3>
<p>This page contains a composite table made of xT, xP and yF data 
objects. After RTParm calculation, the table will contain T,P values and
 thermodynamic properties, arranged in a row per T,P pair. The tXName 
and tLnam fields contain table headers (also shown on the plots), these 
can be edited at any time. The contents of yF table can be plotted 
against the selected abscissa (xT or xP) upon clicking on the "Plot 
Data..." toolbar button. These contents can also be selected, copied to 
clipboard, or pasted from the clipboard using the right-click menu. <br>

<h2><a name="RTPARM_OPERATION"></a>4. RTParm module operation&nbsp; </h2>

<p>Several RTParm records can be created for one DComp or one ReacDC
record. The RTParm function, taken together with flexibility of DComp
and ReacDC definitions
implemented in the GEMS code, provides a substantial help for matching
thermodynamic
data and extending the project thermodynamic database. Since the same
DCthermo()
and RCthermo() routines are used in both RTParm and <a href="gm_project.html">System Project</a> calculations, the tests done
by
RTParm will make you confident that nothing unexpected can happen with
thermodynamic
data during calculation of equilibria at non-ambient temperatures and
pressures.

<hr size="2" width="100%">
<h3><a name="RTPARM_ITERATORS"></a>4.1. Setting up the RTParm iterators<br>
</h3>
<p>On the "Scripts" page of RTParm window, you can see two iterators
(three-cell
columns) <small><a href="#rpPi_0"><big><tt>rpPi</tt></big></a></small>
and
<small><a href="#rpTi_0"><big><tt>rpTi</tt></big></a></small>. There
you
can specify minimum, maximum and increment of pressure and temperature,
if
different from default values (0 to 375 <sup>o</sup>C in 15 <sup>o</sup>C
increments at P<sub>SAT</sub>). The <small><a href="#rpMode"><big><tt>rpMode</tt></big></a></small>
parameter defines in which order the <i>P</i> &nbsp;and <i>T</i>
&nbsp;values
will be iterated, and the <small><a href="#rpNpT_0"><big><tt>rpNpT</tt></big></a></small>
fields define how many pressure and temperature points will be
generated,
together with the total number of <i>T,P</i> &nbsp;points that depends
on
<big><tt>rpMode</tt></big> value. The numbers of&nbsp; <i>P</i>
&nbsp;and
<i>T</i> &nbsp;points must be consistent with the respective iterator
values.

<br>



<hr size="2" width="100%"><p></p>
<h3><a name="RTPARM_SAMPLE_SCRIPTS"></a>4.2. Writing RTparm data
sampling math scritps<br>
</h3>
<p>The data calculated at each <i>P,T</i> &nbsp;point are put by the
program
into data fields visible in the "TPwork" page of the RTParm window. A
math
script (<small><a href="#tExpr"><big><tt>tExpr</tt></big></a></small>
field
on the "Scripts" page) is needed to copy (or re-calculate) the
necessary
values and store them into <big><tt><small><a href="#xT">xT</a></small>,
<small><a href="#xP">xP</a></small></tt></big> &nbsp;and &nbsp; <a href="#yF"><tt>yF</tt></a> &nbsp;arrays (visible on the "Tables"
page).
The template scripts can be found in the SDref database (e.g.&nbsp;
"mscript:0001:rtparm:" record key) after you have pressed the <big><tt>F3</tt></big>
hot key.
Such a script must use an internal&nbsp; <small><a href="#jTP"><big><tt>jTP</tt></big></a></small>
index variable - the current index of the processed <i>P,T</i>
&nbsp;point;
the program will run the script automatically, iterating it through the
whole
sequence of <i>T,P&nbsp;</i> points after the "Record" "Calculate"
menu
command is executed or the "Calculate" toolbar button is pressed.</p>
<br>


<hr size="2" width="100%"><p></p>
<h3><a name="RTPARM_RUN"></a>4.3. Running RTParm calculations<br>
</h3>
<p>Calculations are performed&nbsp; with "Record" "Calculate" command
or
"Calculate" toolbar button. It is advisable to save the RTParm record
to
database when the program will ask for that. The results will be collected in xT, xP and yF arrays visible in Tables window.<br>
</p>
<br>


<hr size="2" width="100%"><p></p>
<h3><a name="RTPARM_PLOT"></a>4.4. Plotting and exporting results<br>
</h3>
<p>When calculations are finished, the results can be displayed
graphically
upon execution of the <tt>"Record" "Plot"</tt> menu command (or
toolbar
button) and can be <a href="gm_gtdemo.html#GTDEMO_PLOT">customized</a>
in
the same way as in the <a href="gm_proces.html">Process</a> or <a href="gm_gtdemo.html#">GtDemo</a> record. <br>
</p>
<p> The calculated data can also be printed into a text file using a <tt>"Record"
"Print"</tt>command using a default (<tt>"pscript:0000:rtparm"</tt>) or
used-defined (as SDref record beginning with <tt>"pscript:..."</tt>)
printing
script.&nbsp; The user can also copy-paste the data into another program using the right-click menu.<br>
</p>
<br>


<hr size="2" width="100%"><h3><a name="RTPARM_SPECIAL"></a>4.5. Special cases of &nbsp;RTParm
calculations</h3>
<p>If you have a few experimental (or otherwise derived empirical) data
points,
you can plot them over the calculated curve(s). To do it, first remake
this
RTParm record; in the RTParm wizard, select number of experimental 
points and number of parameters per points. Then switch to the Setup 
page of the RTParm window. There you
will
see new data objects <tt><a href="#xTE">xTE</a>, <a href="#xPE">xPE</a></tt>
(abscissas) and <a href="#ytE"><tt>yTE</tt></a> (ordinate(s)). Enter
there
your experimental data and plot the results again, as described above.
You
can customize the xTE-yTE plot by setting its line size 0 and symbol
size
8 or 10, to represent experimental data as large scattered
symbols.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>Now, you can perform simple trial-and-error fitting of temperature (or pressure) correction
parameters
against experimental data by changing them in the "parent" DComp (or
ReacDC)
record and then repeating the RTParm calculation and plotting. <br>
