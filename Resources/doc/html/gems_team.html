<h3><a name="HISTORY"></a>History of Development</h3>


<p> GEM-Selektor belongs to a SELEKTOR family of program codes that
implement a convex programming approach to Gibbs energy minimization
calculations of chemical thermodynamic equilibria, developed since 1974
in the laboratory of Prof. Igor K.Karpov at the A.P.Vinogradov
Institute of Geochemistry, Irkutsk, Russia.</p>


<p>The first Selektor code (based on a combination of "steepest
descent" and Newton minimization algorithms) for BESM-6 mainframes
appeared in 1975. Since then, the code was used in many academic
institutions in&nbsp; the former USSR to solve chemical equilibrium
problems in various scientific and applied fields. The modern IPM
minimization algorithm has been developed by I.K.Karpov,
V.A.Detkovskaya and K.V.Chudnenko in 1984-1988. At the same time, a
Selektor-3 code has been re-written in PL/1 for IBM-360 compatible
mainframes.</p>


<p>An interactive concept for Selektor implementation on PC was
suggested by D.Kulik in 1990, when a collaboration between his group at
the academic Institute of Geochemistry and Mineral Physics, Kyiv
(Ukraine) and Prof. Karpov's laboratory (Irkutsk, Russia) was
established. Since then (in 1991-1999), D.Kulik's group at the
Environmental Radiogeochemistry Centre and the SSE Technocentre, Kyiv,
Ukraine (S.Dmitrieva), collaborated in the development and application
of SELEKTOR codes.</p>


<p>These activities became even more international since 1992,
supported in part through several research grants (International
Science Foundation, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, European Science
Foundation, NAS/NRC OCEE Radioactive Waste Program) and scientific
excahnge programs for D.A.Kulik (at Institute for Baltic Sea Research
Warnemuende, Rostock; University of Bonn; J.Gutenberg University,
Mainz, Germany; Brooklyn College of CUNY, USA; Paul Scherrer Institute,
Switzerland).&nbsp; Most of this support was aimed at development of
geochemical modeling applications in marine- and environmental
geochemistry; naturally, this work gave important feedback and ideas
for improvement and further development of software and thermodynamic
database. This work has also resulted in an extension of GEM&nbsp;
technique to surface complexation on mineral-water interfaces (Kulik,
2000, 2002, 2006), which has been implemented since 1995 in Selektor-A
and GEMS version 1 codes.&nbsp; </p>


<p>Since June 2000, the development of GEMS code has been taken over by
the Waste Management Laboratory at the Paul Scherrer Institute
(Switzerland) in continuing collaboration with Prof. Karpov's
laboratory and SSE Technocentre, Kiev (S.Dmitrieva). in 2001, the GEM
IPM module (numerical&nbsp; "engine" of Selektor codes) has been
upgraded into an IPM-2 module, yielding a 9 order of magnitude gain in
the mass-balance precision of GEM technique, which made it possible to
use GEM in most demanding geochemical applications involving trace
elements and radionuclides. The IPM-2 module, together with an improved
graphical user's interface powered by the Qt Toolkit, forms a basis of
GEM-Selektor v.2-PSI program package. </p>


<p>The first release of the GEMS-PSI version 2.0 code with built-in
edition of NAGRA-PSI thermochemical database, oriented mainly to
aquatic systems and applications in performance assessment in
radioactive waste disposal, took place by the end of 2003 on this web
site (http://gems.web.psi.ch/).</p>


<p>Since 2008, the GEM-Selektor code is developed jointly by the PSI
LES and the ETHZ IGP teams. The emphasis of PSI team is in modeling
applications of GEMS and GEMS3K (formerly GEMIPM2K) for scientific
issues related to nuclear waste disposal. The emphasis of IGP team is
in modeling applications of both codes in various areas of hydrothermal
ore geochemistry and geothermal research. Conversely, this
collaborative development is expected to lead to much broader
acceptance of GEM-Selektor in geochemical research community. These
efforts led to even more stable and precise GEM IPM algorithm, as well
as introduction of the TSolMod class library and data interface for
built-in models of mixing of phases-solutions. The present GEM-Selektor
v.3 and GEMS3K codes comprise the outcome of these efforts.</p>
