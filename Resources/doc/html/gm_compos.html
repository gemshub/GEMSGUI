<h2><a name="COMPOS_INTRO"></a>1. Introduction&nbsp;</h2>
<p> This chain of GEMS database records contains definitions
of&nbsp; Predefined Composition Objects (PCO) such as rocks, ores,
waters, fluids etc. Compos records are very versatile in the choice of 
forms in which the compositions can be entered. Upon calculation of 
Compos record, all input data will be automatically converted into
a single PCO vector containing number of moles of all
involved Independent Components (<a href="gm_icomp.html">IComp</a>). </p>
<p>PCOs are accessible through the list of&nbsp; Compos record keys in
the "System" "Compos" window, very convenient for setting up the <a href="gems_bcc.html">bulk
elemental composition </a>of a complex chemical system. Since each PCO is
referred to as a single entity, the user can specify any desired number of
grams, moles etc. of it in the system recipe, to be added to the bulk chemical composition
vector&nbsp; <i>n<sup>(b)</sup></i>&nbsp; - the main input data in GEM calculation
of equilibria in chemical systems. If complex ingredients are
involved, such as rocks or sea-salt, this functionality may save users a
lot of&nbsp; time. <br>
</p>
<p>The default database of GEM-Selektor contains many simple Compos 
records that will be automatically copied into a newly-created are in 
most cases sufficient for assembling complex recipes of geochemical 
systems. Any missing PCO can be created by the user in project database 
after switching to the Database mode of GEM-Selektor.<br>
</p>

<p>Addressing Compos names in the <a href="gm_proces.html">Process
Simulator </a><a href="gmscript.html">scripts</a> will also let the user to simulate various mixing processes in batch calculations in a
quite simple and efficient way, as well as to define the "process
extent" reaction-path models with changing rock/water or rock/fluid ratios,
evaporation, weathering etc. </p>
<p>Each PCO has a unique name (identifier) in the first field of the <a href="gems_rekey.html#DBM_Compos">record key</a> and, regardless of the
particular specification, contains numbers of moles of <a href="gm_icomp.html">Independent Components</a>. Upon creation of
Compos records, the GEM-Selektor code offers several flexible and efficient <a href="#QUANCON">methods for specification</a> of GCO compositions via
molar, mass, volume fractions, molality or molarity units, and absolute
masses or number of moles of IC, DC or user-defined stoichiometries.
Virtually any published composition can be represented close to its
original appearance by creating a Compos record. </p>
<p>As usual in GEM-Selektor, the easiest way to create a new PCO (in addition
to some provided in the Default database) is to "clone" existing Compos
records with "Record" "Create" or "Record" "Save As" menu commands,
then remake and re-calculate the new records whenever appropriate. The
new Compos record keys will be automatically added to the <a href="gm_project.html">modelling project system definition</a> when you open it next time.</p>

<h3><a name="COMPOS_CALC"></a>1.1. Compos Module Calculations</h3>
<p>Let us consider an example of
stoichiometry of 1 kg of simplified haplogranite with the composition expressed through five petrogenic oxides: </p>

  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p>In Database mode of GEM-Selektor, as described in Section 2, first create a new Compos record "<tt>Ha-granite:RO:Haplogranite-simplified</tt>". in the 'Step 1..." page of the <a href="#COMPOS_MWIZARD">Compos Wizard</a>,
 set the number of user-defined formula units to 5, skip 'Step 2...' and
 finish the wizard. In the appearing list of Independent Components, 
just mark one of those involved in the above table (e.g. oxygen) and 
click 'Ok' to proceed. <br>
</p>
<p>This brings you into the <a href="#COMPOS_MWINDOW">Compos window</a>. In the 'PCO' page, type "Haplogranite-simplified (1 kg)" and "Test" into comment lines, then enter 1 into the <a href="#MasVol_0"><tt>MasVol[0]</tt></a> cell, to normalize the PCO mass to 1.0 kg, and check that the <a href="#MasVol_6"><tt>MasVol[6]</tt></a> cell contains 0. Switch to the 'Settings' page and enter the formula units from the above table into the <a href="#formU"><tt>formU</tt></a> column. Enter the '%' code for all formula units into the <a href="#AUcl"><tt>AUcl</tt></a> column, and the respective mass percentages into the <a href="#CA"><tt>CA</tt></a> column. This should result in a table like shown below:</p>
<br>
<img alt="ComposSettingsPage1.png" src="ComposSettingsPage1.png" height="243" width="383"><br>
<br>
<p>Now, switch to the 'PCO' page and click the 'Calculate' toolbar button. This will compute the <a href="#PCO"><tt>PCO</tt></a> stoichiometry, as shown below.</p>
<br>
<img alt="Compos-PCO-Page1.png" src="Compos-PCO-Page1.png" height="353" width="701"><br>
<br>
<p>The PCO composition is expressed in moles, and normalized to 1 kg 
total mass (or 49.8067 total moles). Now the record can be saved to 
project database; it will be added to the Compos list in the chemical 
system definition when the modeling project is open next time. One mole 
of this PCO means exactly one kilogram mass added to the system 
composition. <br>
</p>
It is very easy to re-normalize the PCO to any given mass. For example, 
to re-normalize the haplogranite composition to 2 kg, enter 2 into the <a href="#MasVol_0"><tt>MasVol[0]</tt></a> cell; 0 into the <a href="#MasVol_6"><tt>MasVol[6]</tt></a>
 cell; and click the "Calculate" toolbar button. Note that, if at least 
one code of mass fraction is used somewhere in the Compos record then 
the <tt>MasVol[0]</tt> cell cannot contain 0. <br>
<p>In general, there are two modes of Compos calculations, depending on what was entered into the <a href="#MasVol_0"><tt>MasVol[0]</tt></a> data field.<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(1) <i>Output mode</i>. If 0 or EMPTY value is entered by the user 
before calculation of the PCO vector, then the resulting Ms value (PCO 
total mass) will be automatically placed into this cell, calculated from
 IC mole amounts in the PCO vector and their molar masses collected from
 the respective IComp records. In this case, mass fraction codes cannot 
be used in any of the columns <tt>CIcl, CDcl</tt>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <tt>AUcl</tt>.<br>
    <br>
(2) <i>Input mode</i>. If any positive value Ms is entered into this 
cell then the PCO composition vector will be normalized to this Ms value
 during the calculation of Compos record data.<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
Normalization occurs as follows: (1) PCO vector elements (moles) are 
calculated, as specified in other data fields of the Compos window; (2) 
the total mass Mp&nbsp; of&nbsp; the PCO is computed by multiplying each
 of the PCO vector elements to molar mass of the respective IC; (3) Each
 PCO vector element is multiplied by a normalization factor Ms/Mp.<br>
<br>
If any positive value Ms&nbsp; is entered then, in addition, some values
 in CI, CD or&nbsp; CA vectors can be specified in mass percent ('%' in 
classifiers&nbsp; <tt>CIcl, CDcl</tt>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <tt>AUcl</tt>) or 
other mass fraction concentration units.&nbsp; In the process of PCO 
calculation, these mass concentrations will be scaled into numbers of 
moles of IC using stoichiometries (where needed) and the provided 
Ms&nbsp; value. <br>
<p>It is good to know that each element of the&nbsp; <tt><a href="#CI">CI</a></tt>,<tt><a href="#CD"> CD</a>&nbsp;</tt> or&nbsp; <tt><a href="#CA">CA</a></tt>&nbsp; vectors can be set up
separately with
its own&nbsp; <a href="g_useref.html#QUANCONCUNITS">units of
concentration</a> code. This&nbsp; gives the user an unmatched freedom
in creating bulk compositions or modifying them. When specifying
different units, one should take care of their "base quantities". For
example, when setting molality units, the mass of water-solvent must
always be set in beforehand. </p>
<p>Read carefully all the tooltips and help pages to the&nbsp; <tt><a href="#MasVol_0">MasVol</a></tt>&nbsp; cells for instructions how to
set base quantities and units of concentration correctly. Examination
of the available Compos records and some experimentation will give you
the right feeling how to work with PCOs. Negative numbers
can be used in the&nbsp; <tt><a href="#CI">CI</a></tt>,&nbsp; <tt><a href="#CD">CD</a>&nbsp;</tt> or&nbsp; <tt><a href="#CA">CA</a></tt>&nbsp;
vectors, as long as they do not produce negative numbers of moles in
the total&nbsp; <tt><a href="#PCO">PCO</a></tt>&nbsp; composition
vector. </p>

<p>Coming back to the haplogranite example, there are many alternative 
ways to express the same PCO. For instance, the record can be 
re-configured such that 1 kg of large formula text is entered into the <a href="#Ctext"><tt>Ctext</tt></a> field:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>(SiO2)10.998(Al2O3)2.0829(K2O)0.5834(Na2O)1.00002(H2O)0.54959</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, the PCO vector can be simply copy-pasted into the CI 
vector (always created automatically, even if not ordered in Compos 
Wizard). For fluid PCOs, it may be convenient to compose them using 
formulae of aqueous ions, complexes, or dissolved minerals from 
DComp/ReacDC records (this gives an additional opportunity to check the 
charge balance). <br>

<h2><a name="COMPOS_MWIZARD"></a>2. Compos Create/Remake Wizard</h2>
<p>This wizard appears when a new Compos record is created or cloned, or a remake is executed for an existing record. </p>
<p>When a new record is created/cloned, the "set a new record key" 
dialog appears first. There, three fields must be specified, as shown 
below for an example of simplified haplogranite composition:</p>
<br>
<img alt="Compos-Record-Key.png" src="Compos-Record-Key.png" height="205" width="510"><br>
<br>
Of these three fields, the first one is the most important because it 
appears in the Project system definition list that can be used for <a href="gems_bcc.html">creating a system recipe</a>. <br>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>

<h3><a name="WZSTEP_1"></a>2.1. Compos Wizard Step 1 - Predefined Composition Object (PCO) configuration</h3>
<p>Compos record contains data for a Predefined Composition Object 
(PCO), which describes a salt, the air, a mineral, a rock, a natural 
water, etc., treated&nbsp; as a single named entity in the chemical 
system recipe.</p>
<p>PCO can be configured according to the source data: as IC or DC 
amounts/concentrations; as user-defined formula (UDF) units; or as a 
large 
user-defined formula entered into a text editor field. All possible 
methods of input can be used simultaneously. Independent Components that
 define this PCO must always be specified. <br>
</p>
<p>Upon re-calculation, all entered quantities will be added (after unit conversion) into a single
 IC mole amounts <a href="#PCO"><tt>PCO</tt></a> vector, optionally scaled to a given total mass <a href="#MasVol_0"><tt>MasVol[0]</tt></a> (in
 kg) or total number of moles <a href="#MasVol_6"><tt>MasVol[6]</tt></a>. This vector is visible on the <a href="#MWPAGE_1">PCO page</a> of <a href="#COMPOS_MWINDOW">Compos window.</a><br>

</p>
<p>(2) In a PCO definition using DC formulae, a list of available 
ReacDC/DComp records will be shown, asking you to mark the desired ones.
 </p>


<p>(3) Page 1 of the 'Compos' window appears. Fill out the BCname 
comment and (optionally) BCnote line. Then enter data and formulae 
wherever needed; check units of amount/concentration.


</p>
<p>(4) Click on 'Calculate' toolbar button to compute the PCO vector. 
Check or enter the normalization values in MasVol[0] and MasVol[6]
