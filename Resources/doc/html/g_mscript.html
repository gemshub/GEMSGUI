<h2><a name="MS_INTRO"></a>1. Introduction - Why Scripts?</h2>
<p>Interpretation of scripts or macros in large program packages (text
processors, web browsers, or CAD systems) is an efficient tool to
reach a compromise between the hard-coded functionality of the
program and the unforeseeable variety of the user's needs and
ideas. This applies in full to geochemical
modelling program packages such as<a href="gm_about.html">
</a>GEM-Selektor. The main GEM IPM
algorithm is hard-coded for the best
performance, as well as the most common techniques for temperature/pressure corrections of
thermodynamic data and ionic
strength corrections for aqueous species. Any addition or change in
the hard-coded methods requires re-compilation and re-linking of the
code; this is not always an easy job for developers, but far more
difficult and time consuming for
the majority of end-users. <br>
</p>
<p> For instance, there is a variety of possible mixing models of mixing for the multi-component phases,
 many of which are available (hard-coded) in TSolMod class library 
(more...), but it is not possible to hard-code all models, also those 
just appearing in the literature. For these reasons, the user must have a
 possibility to
encode in a simple way, right in the Phase database records, the most
flexible calculations using any data that will exist at the run time in
the program memory. In this
way, the users can extend the database and "teach" the program package
without any need to re-compile it. <br>
</p>
<p>In general, there is also no way to hard-code in advance all
possible meaningful
"<a href="gm_proces.html">process simulation</a>" scenarios that may be
of
interest to (geo)chemists. Hence, in the GEM-Selektor code, simulation
of
any irreversible process (as a series of local/partial equilibrium states) can be
defined as a process script (part of the <a href="gm_proces.html">Process</a> record) where the user writes what
exactly and where should be changed in the <a href="gems_sys.html">system
definition</a> (stored as <a href="gm_syseq.html">SysEq</a> records)
to produce the next step of the simulated sequence of <a href="gems_ipm.html">equilibrium states</a>. <br>
</p>
<p>To &nbsp;watch what has been actually calculated, the user must also
be able to tell the program what output data to collect,&nbsp; display
(ideally, in comparison with some experimental points), copy-paste, and 
print. Scripts can be very helpful in accomplishing such needs; the 
"data
sampling" scripts (in <a href="gm_rtparm.html">RTparm</a>, <a href="gm_proces.html">Process</a>
and <a href="gm_gtdemo.html">GtDemo</a> records) provide maximum
flexibility and performance in collecting only relevant results, thus
saving a lot of time - especially if many modeled points were generated
for a large chemical system. <br>
</p>
<p>Scripts can also be embedded into the <a href="pe_script.html">print/export</a>
and <a href="i_script.html">import</a> format scripts of GEM-Selektor.
This should provide the user with even more freedom and flexibility
because all numeric input and output data objects visible on the module
window pages are accessible to format- and math scripts via their
labels and indices. The user can organize the output of relevant data
only, scaling them to the chosen units of measurement, and presented in
the required format.<br>
<br>
In the forthcoming versions of GEM-Selektor code, the syntax of
math scripts will be updated for the conformance with
the ECMAscript standard (already used, for instance, in JavaScript). In
this case, a conversion utility for the present-style scripts will be
provided. <br>
</p>
&nbsp;
<hr size="2" width="100%">

<h2> <a name="MS_INTERPRETER"></a>2. GEM-Selektor Built-In Script
Interpreter</h2>
GEM-Selektor contains a built-in interpreter that converts the scripts 
(i.e. texts containing user-defined operators and expressions) into an 
internal
binary code. This code is then automatically executed when
necessary during the program operation.&nbsp;
<p>The GEM-Selektor scripts are written in a rather simple
language that
combines features of Basic and C programming languages. The only kind
of
identifiers that can be used in scripts are <a href="#MS_DOD_LABELS">labels
of data objects</a>, usually visible on GEM-Selektor module window
pages. Through these labels with optional indexes, the math scripts can
access numerical data (integer, float and double precision formats are
automatically detected) arranged as scalars, line- or column- vectors
or
matrices. Very limited set of operations can be performed also on ASCII
string objects.&nbsp; No identifiers other than valid data object
labels
(up to 6 characters long) are allowed in math scripts; in other words,
the math script interpreter cannot create new names of variables, although
it can create any number of numerical or logical constants. Many <a href="#MS_BUILTIN_FUNCTIONS">built-in mathematical functions </a>are
available within script expressions. <br>
</p>
<p>There are three stages of processing a source script. <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>At the first (<a href="#MS_PREPROC">preprocessing</a>) stage,
the script text will be checked for the presence of explicit names of
Independent Components (IComp), Dependent Components (DComp or ReacDC),
Phases, and Predefined Composition Objects (Compos) &nbsp;in place of
indexes. If such a name is found, the respective name list will be
searched through until the numerical index for this component, phase, or PCO is
detected. Then the name will be replaced by the numerical index (which
is often unknown before the actual calculation begins). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the second (translation) stage, all math script operators
will be parsed, analyzed, converted into the inverse Polish notation code
and table of constants, and stored in an internal binary data
structure. In the case of a syntax error, a dialog box will appear,
displaying the remaining unprocessed part of the source script. In most
cases, translation will
be resumed after the user has corrected the error(s). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the third (execution) stage, the run-time calculation will be
performed using a stack-based algorithm and the binary (translated)
code, whenever necessary. Run-time errors (such as zero-divide), in
principle, may produce invalid results or crash of the code;
fortunately, this rarely happens because in most cases, the error
exceptions are generated, and <a href="#MS_ERROR_MESSAGES">error messages</a> will be displayed. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
 &nbsp;

<h3> <a name="MS_DOD_LABELS"></a>2.1. Data Object Types and Labels in
GEM-Selektor</h3>
<p>The GEM-Selektor GUI (Graphical User's Interface) can access any
data object
that exists in the program memory and has a "Data Object Descriptor"
(DOD).
DOD is a small structure containing a label (up to 6 ASCII Latin1
characters)
of the data object, a pointer to its memory location, information about
the
type, cell size, number of cells in the column and in the row, and a link
to
a short comment (tooltip). Creation of DODs is hard-coded, but their
contents
can be changed in some cases at runtime, during the program operation
(for
instance, at remake or input of database records). </p>
<p>There are two kinds of data objects (and, accordingly, DODs): static
and dynamic. Static data have the same location, type and size during
the whole program execution time, while dynamic data can be re-sized, moved
in memory, and even converted into another data cell type. The latter can
be numerical (integer, float, double), fixed- and variable-size
strings, and one-byte type. This information can be obtained from the Help window index.
<br>
</p>
<p>In GEM-Selektor, the DOD array for more than 1000 data objects makes a
bridge between the GUI window pages, the internal data structures, the
database records, the runtime HTML help system, and the
interpreters of math scripts, print/export, and import scripts. The
DOD labels with indices serve as identifiers in script expressions
and other kinds of scripts. Skipped index is interpreted as zero index;
hence, a DOD label written without indexes will be interpreted as the
same label with two zero
indexes. Each index is counted from <tt>0</tt> to <tt>N-1</tt> or <tt>0</tt>
to <tt>M-1</tt>, where <tt>N</tt> is the number of rows and <tt>M</tt>
is the number of columns in the (numerical) data object. Both <tt>N</tt>
and <tt>M</tt> are known in any valid DOD (i.e. any DOD that points to
a
valid memory location). &nbsp; </p>
&nbsp;
<hr size="2" width="100%"><h3> <a name="MS_WHERE_TO_USE"></a>2.2. Where Scripts Can be Used</h3>
<p> Scripts can be used in definitions of the
non-ideal multi-component phases (<a href="gm_phase.html">Phase</a>
records, <tt><a href="gm_phase.html#DcEq">DcEq</a><a href="gm_phase.html#PhEq"> </a>and
<a href="gm_phase.html#PhEq">PhEq</a></tt>&nbsp; text editor fields), process
simulators (<a href="gm_proces.html">Process</a> records, <tt><a href="gm_proces.html#P_expr">P_expr</a></tt> and &nbsp;<tt><a href="gm_proces.html#pgExpr">pgExpr</a></tt> text editor fields),&nbsp;
graphic/table demo samplers (<a href="gm_gtdemo.html">GtDemo</a>
records, <tt><a href="gm_gtdemo.html#gExpr">gExpr</a></tt> text editor field), and
thermodynamic data tabulators (<a href="gm_rtparm.html">RTparm</a>
records, <tt><a href="gm_rtparm.html#tExpr">tExpr</a></tt> text editor field).
These record types embrace the most versatile data in thermodynamic
modeling. In addition, math scripts can be embedded within the <a href="pe_script.html">print-</a>, <a href="pe_script.html">export-</a>
and <a href="i_script.html">import</a> format scripts.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Like any programming, writing math scripts requires some experience,
understanding of principles of operation, and some care to avoid
unnecessary debugging or program crash. The best way to learn efficient
programming is to read and modify working examples. For this reason,
GEM-Selektor program package is distributed with a library of template
math scripts. This library (in form of SDref records) contains a
collection of some typical solutions and is very easy to extend: every
user can open a script record, save it under a different record key,
and modify as necessary. The users are encouraged to share their
favorite template math scripts with other users and even with the
developers. </p>
<p>To facilitate writing scripts even more, several create/remake 
wizards can automatically assemble simple scripts upon selection of 
items in selection lists. For instance, this can be done in <a href="gm_rtparm.html#RTPARM_MWIZARD">RTParm Wizard</a>, <a href="gm_proces.html#PROCES_MWIZARD">Process Wizard</a>, and <a href="gm_gtdemo.html#GTDEMO_MWIZARD">GtDemo Wizard</a>.
 Thus assembled scripts can be immediately executed after the Wizard is 
finished by clicking "Calculate" button. Any script can be 
edited/enhanced by editing it in the respective module window page. If 
such edited scripts exist in the database record, the respective wizard 
pages should be skipped upon remake, otherwise the edited contents will 
be lost.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<hr size="2" width="100%">
<p> </p>
<h2> <a name="MS_SYNTAX"></a>3. Script Syntax and Operators</h2>&nbsp;
Any script is a text containing optional comment lines and a sequence
of one or more <a href="MS_AREX">operators</a> of a
general form:
<p><tt>&lt; variable &gt; =: &lt; arithmetic expression &gt; ;</tt> </p>
<p>here,<tt> =: </tt>stands for an assignment operator;
semicolon&nbsp; <tt>;</tt> &nbsp;marks the end of expression. <br>
</p>
<p>Result of &nbsp;<tt>&lt; arithmetic expression &gt; </tt>is a
double-precision numerical value. After calculation, this value is
assigned to <tt>&lt; variable &gt;</tt>&nbsp;(i.e. written into memory
location pointed by&nbsp; <tt>&lt; variable &gt;</tt>); data type
conversion&nbsp; is performed automatically, if necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any text beginning with the <tt>&nbsp;$</tt> &nbsp;character until
the end of line is considered as a comment and will not be translated.
Comments may occur anywhere in place of space characters. Any number of
comment lines is allowed. <br>
</p>
<p>All variable identifiers (DOD labels), keywords, and function names
are case sensitive.<br></p>
&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<h3><a name="MS_AREX"></a>3.1. Arithmetic Expressions</h3>
<p> To specify an arithmetic expression, the <a href="#MS_VAR">variables</a>
(identified using DOD labels
only), <a href="#MS_CONST">constants</a>,&nbsp; <a href="#MS_BUILTIN_FUNCTIONS">built-in functions</a> and <a href="#MS_OP_PRIORITY">operations</a> can be used. <br>
</p>
<p>Brackets <tt>( ) </tt>serve
for changing the default priorities of operations. </p>

<p>Syntax of an arithmetic expression (in BNF recursive
notation, \ \ &nbsp;contain alternatives separated by | symbol "or",
braces <tt>{}</tt> contain optional items that may or may not exist ):
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>&lt; arithmetic expression &gt; ::= &lt; term &gt; { \ + | - \
&lt; term &gt; }</tt> </p>
  <p> <tt>&lt; term &gt; ::= &lt; pfactor &gt; { \ * | / \ &lt;

</blockquote>
<p><br>
All numerical operands are converted into double-precision
floating-point numbers before applying arithmetic operations. The
result is also a double-precision number.</p>
<p> <br>
</p>

<hr size="2" width="100%">
<h3> <a name="MS_VAR"></a>3.2. Variables</h3>
<p> Any variable must begin with an&nbsp; <b>identifie</b><b>r</b>
&nbsp;(i.e. name up to 6 alphanumeric characters, beginning with a Latin
letter), which is interpreted as a DOD label existing in the GEM-Selektor program at the moment of
translation and execution of the math script. Any other names will be
considered as errors (i.e. math scripts are not allowed to create new
variables). There are&nbsp; three forms of variables that may be used in
math scripts: </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p> scalars (example: <tt>pH</tt>&nbsp; )</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p> elements of vectors ( example:&nbsp; <tt>x[j] </tt>)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p> elements of matrices (example:&nbsp; <tt>a[j][i] </tt>)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> Data types are automatically determined from the data object descriptors (DODs). Formal syntax in
BNF notation is: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>&lt; variable &gt; ::= &lt; identifier &gt; | &lt; identifier
&gt; [ &lt; index &gt; ] | &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</tt><tt>&lt;
identifier &gt; [ &lt; index &gt; ] [ &lt; index &gt; ]</tt></p>
  <p><tt>&lt; index &gt; ::= &lt; arithmetic expression &gt;</tt> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><tt>Identifier</tt> &nbsp;is a sequence of up to 6 Latin letters
(including underscore symbol) and digits beginning with a letter. Math
scripts
are case sensitive, so&nbsp; <tt>pH</tt>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <tt>Ph</tt>&nbsp;
are different identifiers.&nbsp; </p>
<p><tt>Index</tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; is any arithmetic expression; only
integer part of it (rounded to the closest integer) will be used.&nbsp;
<tt><br>
</tt></p>
<p><tt>Variable</tt>&nbsp; &nbsp;cannot have more than two indices. <br>
</p>
<p>If
only one index is written then it is considered as an absolute
(one-dimensional) index even for matrices. <br>
</p>
<p>Matrix elements are counted
row-by-row, as
in C language. <br>
</p>
<p>Absence of an&nbsp; <tt>index</tt>&nbsp; is regarded as
zero absolute index, that is, the variable refers to the first cell of
the data object.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<hr size="2" width="100%">
<h3> <a name="MS_FUNCTIONS"></a>3.3. Functions</h3>
<p> The script interpreter permits usage of <a href="#MS_BUILTIN_FUNCTIONS"><b>built-in functions</b></a> in all
expressions.
As arguments, either <a href="#MS_AREX">arithmetic expressions</a> or <a href="#MS_BF_INTERVAL"><b>intervals</b></a> can be specified. </p>
<p><tt>Interval</tt> &nbsp;is a construction of the form &nbsp;<tt>x[ib:ie]</tt>,
which tells the function to process all cells of a vector or matrix
with indices fitting inside of &nbsp; <tt>ib:ie</tt>&nbsp; interval,
including &nbsp;<tt>ib</tt> &nbsp;and &nbsp;<tt>ie</tt> &nbsp;indices.
Syntax in BNF notation: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>&lt; function &gt; ::= &lt; function identifier &gt; ( &lt;
argument &gt; ) |</tt> <br>
  <tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt; function
identifier &gt; ( &lt; argument &gt; , &lt; argument &gt; )<br>
  </tt> <br>
  <tt>&lt; argument &gt; ::= &lt; arithmetic expression &gt; | &lt;
interval &gt;</tt>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> <tt>&lt; interval &gt; ::= &lt; identifier &gt; |</tt> <br>
  <tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&lt; identifier &gt; [ &lt; index &gt; : &lt; index &gt; ] |</tt>
  <br>
  <tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt; identifier &gt; [ &lt;
index &gt; : &lt; index &gt; ][ &lt; index &gt; : &lt; index &gt; ]</tt>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Number of square brackets with indices or intervals cannot exceed
two. By default, <tt>[ 0:N-1 ] </tt>or <tt>[ 0:M-1 ]</tt> intervals
are taken, where&nbsp; <tt>N</tt>&nbsp; or&nbsp; <tt>M</tt>&nbsp; are
current dimensions in the data object descriptor referenced by the <tt>identifier</tt>.&nbsp; <br>
</p><br>
<hr size="2" width="100%">
<h3> <a name="MS_LOGIC"></a>3.4. Logical Expressions</h3>
<p>Internal predefined constants&nbsp; <tt>ONE_</tt>&nbsp; (true)
and&nbsp; <tt>NUL_</tt>&nbsp; (false) are used for logical values in
math scripts. Logical value <tt>NUL_</tt> is equal to the numerical
value 0.0. Any other value (greater than 1e-34) is considered as <span style="font-family: monospace;">ONE_</span>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When a <b>logical expression</b> is calculated, any result
different from&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>NUL_</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; is considered as <tt>ONE_</tt>
(true). The syntax is: </p>
<blockquote><tt>&lt; logical expression &gt; ::= ( &lt; condition &gt; ?</tt>
  <br>
  <tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;

<p> Various <a href="#MS_BUILTIN_FUNCTIONS">built-in functions</a>&nbsp;
can be used in GEM-Selektor scripts. These functions are
hard-coded, some of them can also be called from within the source
code. There
are three classes of functions: &nbsp;those <a href="#MS_BF_ARITHM">with
arithmetic arguments</a>; with <a href="#MS_BF_INTERVAL">interval
arguments</a>; and with index or without arguments (mainly <a href="#MS_BF_CHEMICAL">chemically-specific functions</a>).&nbsp; </p>
<p>During execution of scripts, such common functions as
logarithms (<tt>
ln, lg</tt> ) or square root &nbsp;(<tt> sqrt )</tt> are called
directly from
C/C++ floating point math libraries and may return errors or exceptions
if
the argument value is wrong. Even though these exceptions are caught
in
the code of script calculator, they still can occasionally cause
abnormal
behavior or crash of the program. <br>

<hr size="2" width="100%"><h2> <a name="MS_PREPROC"></a>5. Indexation in GEM-Selektor Lists and Script Preprocessing</h2>
<h3>Name-Index Substitutions</h3>
<p>
Data structures for calculation of equilibria in GEM-Selektor are very
flexible; any Independent Component, Dependent Component (species), or Phase can be excluded
from the run-time <a href="gems_ipm.html">GEM IPM</a> problem by turning it off in the <a href="gems_sys.html">system definition</a>.
For this reason, a numerical index of a particular species or phase may
vary from one IPM task to another. Hence, it would be&nbsp; very
inconvenient to use explicit (numerical) indexes in math script
equations in the Phase, Process and
GtDemo records. Instead, a big advantage would be to use names of
species
or components directly,&nbsp; instead of numerical indices, wherever
possible.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>To make scripts easier to read and compatible between
different system definitions, a pre-processing step is performed before
the actual translation and execution of the script. During
pre-processing, the names of phases,
species and compositions are identified, extracted and converted into
into
their actual run-time indexes. This is done automatically because the
program
knows which list of names is to be searched for a given data object
label
(coded in a configuration file&nbsp; <tt>vis_od.ini</tt>). All the user has
to
do when writing the script is to put the species- or phase name in
braces
in place of the numerical index value, for instance: <tt>&nbsp;x[{CaCO3@}]</tt>
&nbsp;instead of &nbsp;<tt>x[24]</tt> . <br>
</p>
<p>During calculation of equilibria, two indexation systems exist in
the data
structures of GEM-Selektor. One system is defined by the full lists of
Independent
Components, Dependent Components, Phases, and PCO for the currently
open
<a href="gems_sys.html">System definition</a> in the <a href="gm_project.html">Project</a> data structure. This indexation is
used also in the vectors for thermodynamic data and system
configuration. </p>
<p>Usually, some elements, species and/or phases are switched off and
must be eliminated from the run-time lists. &nbsp;Therefore, another
set of
(usually smaller) lists of Independent Components, Dependent
Components,
and Phases is automatically created within the GEM IPM run-time data
structure according to the configuration switches in the system
definition (i.e. in currently loaded SysEq record).&nbsp; The second
indexation
system is also applied when a SysEq record is expanded for the GtDemo
data sampling.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>Both the full (<a href="gems_sys.html">Project</a>) and the
condensed
(<a href="gems_ipm.html">IPM</a>) indexation systems are connected by
three special data objects&nbsp; <tt><a href="gems_ipm.html#mui">mui</a></tt>,
<tt><a href="gems_ipm.html#muj">muj</a></tt> and <tt><a href="gems_ipm.html#mup">mup</a></tt> that belong to the IPM runtime data structure. Given that<tt> i, j</tt> and <tt>k</tt> are
indexes of
an Independent Component, a Dependent Component and a Phase,
respectively,
in the IPM runtime structure, the corresponding indexes <tt>I, J</tt>,
and <tt>K</tt> for these components and phase in the System definition
can
be calculated as follows: <tt>I = mui[i]; J = muj[j]; K = mup[k]</tt>.
<br>
</p>
<p>For example, let us assign a value of normalized chemical potential
of Ca+2 &nbsp;ion to a Qd[2] work cell, assuming that Ca+2 is the sixth
species of the aqueous phase in a particular equilibrium problem. This can
be written in the script as the following operator (remember that the indexation begins from
0): </p>
<p><tt>Qd[2] =: fMu[5];</tt> </p>
<p>But this writing is valid only for this particular case. If some
species will be turned off or on, or the script will &nbsp;be used in
another modeling project, the index of Ca+2 ion may become different,
and the above operator will produce a wrong result. A more safe and
general expression (to be
preprocessed) looks like this: </p>
<p><tt>Qd[2] =: fMu[{Ca+2}];</tt> <br>
<tt></tt><br>
The preprocessor will locate the string in braces (<tt>"Ca+2"</tt>) and
look for the first match of it in the run-time list of species names <tt>DCnam</tt>
(in this example, the match will occur in 6-th line of the list). Then
the sub-string {Ca+2} will be substituted by 5, yielding <tt>Qd[2] =:
fMu[5];</tt> and later on, the operator will be translated
as
usual. </p>
<p>Another example: suppose that gypsum (CaSO<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>)
is included as a Dependent Component both in the System definition and
in the IPM runtime structure. Then the stoichiometry coefficient
of Ca in gypsum can be obtained as: </p>
<p><tt>Qd[3] =: A[Ca}][{gypsum}];</tt> </p>
<p>Standard molar Gibbs energy of gypsum, taken from the thermodynamic
data vector in the modelling project structure, will be: </p>
<p><tt>Qd[4] =: &nbsp;gTP[{gypsum}];</tt> <br>
</p>
<p>or, alternatively (nested index expressions are allowed in math
scripts): <br>
</p>
<p><tt>Qd[4] =: &nbsp;gTP[ muj[{gypsum}] ];</tt> <br>
</p>
<p>The normalized standard molar Gibbs energy of gypsum, kept in the
thermodynamic data vector in the IPM runtime structure (Multi), can be
extracted in this way: </p>
<p><tt>Qd[5] =: g0[{gypsum}];</tt> </p>
<p>Note that the index for gypsum in the IPM runtime structure will
most
probably be different (smaller) than that for gypsum in the project
system
definition, if some independent or dependent components were turned
off.
<br>
</p>

<h3>Separation of Groups of Expressions</h3>
<p>A special pre-processing may be performed for math scripts in the DcEq
field of Phase window. This is controlled by a switch&nbsp; <tt><a href="gm_phase.html#p_solt_4">p_solt[0,4]</a></tt> in<tt> </tt>Phase
records.&nbsp; If this switch is set in a <a href="g_useref.html#P_SOLT4">"private" mode</a> then a &nbsp;separate
group of math script expressions must be written for every phase
end-member. Each group is closed by <tt>"\@"</tt> characters that must
directly follow the <tt>";"</tt> symbol of the last operator in the
group. The groups of expressions must be placed in the same order as
the species in the <a href="gm_phase.html#pDC_v_"><tt>pDC_v_</tt></a>
list on Page 1 of the Phase window. <br>
</p>
<p>The pre-processing is necessary because, if a j-th species is
switched off
in the system definition, the respective "private" group of math script
operators
must be skipped from the math script execution. This is achieved by
looking
for the next (j-th) <tt>"\@" </tt>in the original math script text
and analyzing
whether the j-th end-member is included or not in the IPM run-time data
structure.
If the end-member is included, the whole group of operators will be
copied
into the math script text to be translated; otherwise, the program
proceeds
to the next end-member (and group).<br>
</p>

<h2> <a name="MS_LIBRARY"></a>6. Template Script Library in Default Database <br>
</h2>
<p>GEM-Selektor code comes with a collection of useful examples of math
scripts called "<a href="gm_sdref.html#MATH_SCRIPT_LIB">template math
script library</a>". &nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>The purpose of this library (that may be extended in future
versions, also with users contribution) is to facilitate writing math
scripts in your modelling projects. Instead of writing "from scratch",
it is much easier to learn by doing, i.e. to select the closest template
script, copy it into clipboard (<tt>Ctrl-V</tt>), paste into the appropriate text field (<tt>Ctrl-C</tt>), and modify
(usually change names of components and phases, or some numerical
constants). This is why the library scripts are called "template": in
almost all cases, they need modification to adjust the expressions to
your particular system formulation.&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>The template scripts are located in <a href="gm_sdref.html">SDref</a>
&nbsp;records
under keys beginning with <tt>"mscript"</tt> and ending with <tt>"phase"</tt>,
<tt>"rtparm", "proces"</tt> or <tt>"gtdemo"</tt> names of modules
where the
scripts can be executed. After opening any such record, you will find
the
scripts on Page 2 of SDref window. There, you can edit or add scripts
or
comments and save the record under a different key into the SDref
&nbsp;file
of your <a href="gm_project.html">modelling project</a>. In this way,
you can
make your own library of your favourite template scripts and, later on,
even
share it with a colleague or with the <a href="gems_about.html">GEMS2-PSI
Development
Team</a>. <br>

<h2><a name="MS_ERROR_MESSAGES"></a>7. Error Messages<tt><br>
</tt></h2>
<p>There are three classes of error messages or warnings that can be
generated when GEM-Selektor processes the math script: pre-processing
messages; translation messages; and execution messages. In the first
two cases, the program will show you the message text together with the
remaining (not yet analyzed) text of the math script. <br>
</p>
<p>Usually, the user will have an opportunity to make necessary corrections
by editing the text and saving the database record with edited script,
then the program will try processing it again. At the execution stage,
when an error message appears, the calculation will be stopped; you
will have to go
back to the record with the original script, correct it (or change some
data
in the record) and try the calculation again.<br>
