<h2><a name="PAGE_ABOUT"></a>ABOUT GEM-SELEKTOR<br>
</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">GEM-Selektor version 3</span>
(GEMS3) is a Gibbs Energy Minimization program package for interactive
thermodynamic modeling of heterogeneous aquatic (geo)chemical systems,
especially those involving metastability and dispersity of mineral
phases, solid solution - aqueous solution equilbria, and adsorption/ion
exchange. Processes of irreversible chemical mass transfer can be
simulated using the principles of local and partial equilibrium. </p>

<p style="margin: 12px 0px; text-indent: 0px;">The GEMS3 package
includes the imported SUPCRT92 code (Johnson et al., 1992) and a
built-in (default) thermodynamic database in both thermochemical and
reaction formats. 'Kernel' part of this database corresponds to the
current edition of the Nagra-PSI database (Hummel et al., 2002).
'Complementary' part consists of the imported SUPCRT (Slop98.dat)
database (Shock et al., 1997), commonly used in hydrothermal
geochemistry. There are specific databases that can be downloaded from
web sites of their developers. </p>

<p style="margin: 12px 0px; text-indent: 0px;">A standalone variant of
GEM solver - <span style="font-weight: bold;">GEMS3K</span> - is also
provided separately for use in coupled reactive transport modeling and
related applications. The same numerical kernel (enhanced with the
interpreter of GEMS Phase scripts) runs inside of the GEMS3 code.</p>

<p style="margin: 12px 0px; text-indent: 0px;">The GEMS3 code is
written in C/C++, using the LGPL v.2.1 version of the Qt4 UI framework
(http://qt-project.org; http://qt.nokia.com) and the GNU gcc compiler,
which makes GEMS3 a cross-platform software for all major Linux, Mac OS
X and Windows systems.</p>

<p style="margin: 12px 0px; text-indent: 0px;">The GEMS3K code (the
numerical kernel of GEMS3) is a C++ program without any GUI, only with
ASCII file I/O, but capable to be compiled and executed also on
parallel architectures. GEMS3K uses the public domain JAMA/C++ linear
algebra package by Roldan Pozo (http://math.nist.gov/tnt).</p>

<h2><a name="OVERVIEW"></a>OVERVIEW</h2>

<p>GEM-Selektor is a Gibbs Energy Minimization program package for
interactive thermodynamic modeling of heterogeneous aquatic
(geo)chemical systems, especially those involving metastability and
dispersity of mineral phases, solid solution - aqueous solution
equilbria, and adsorption/ion exchange. Includes a built-in (default)
thermodynamic database in both thermochemical and reaction formats, and
an advanced multi-document graphical user interface with
context-sensitive help system.</p>

<p>This chapter is for people who have never used&nbsp; GEM-Selektor or
other Gibbs energy minimisation codes, and, perhaps, have never done
geochemical modelling. If you are already familiar with the subject and
just try to learn a particular feature or technical information, you
can probably skip three sections below. <br>
</p>

<p> </p>

<h3> <a name="WHATIS"></a>What is GEM-Selektor?</h3>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p> GEM-Selektor (GEMS) is a geochemical modelling code. It uses an
advanced convex programming method of Gibbs energy minimization (GEM)
implemented as an efficient Interior Points Method (IPM) in the GEMS3K
kernel module.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using GEMS, you can compute an equilibrium phase assemblage and
speciation in a complex chemical system with many phases-solutions from
its total bulk elemental composition at given temperature and pressure
(optionally, subject&nbsp; to additional kinetic metastability
constraints).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TSolMod The code includes a TSolMod library of built-in phase
models of non-ideal mixing, relevant to a wide range of applications in
geochemistry</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chemical interactions involving solids, solid solutions, metls,
gas/fluid mixture, aqueous electrolyte, (non-)electrostatic surface
complexation, and ion exchange can be considered simultaneously in the
chemical elemental stoichiometry (+ electrical charge) of the system,
i.e. without any mass balance constraints for ligands or surface sites.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GEMS package includes a built-in write-protected default
chemical thermodynamic data base, selected parts of which are
automatically copied into your&nbsp; modelling project data base upon
creation of the modeling project, where the thermodynamic and
compositional input data are immediately available for calculation of
equilibrium states. This data base can be extended or corrected at any
time, and changes will have no effect on the default database supplied
with the program.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within a modeling project, all you have to do is, in principle,
to provide a recipe, i.e. the bulk composition of your system and,
possibly, exclude some irrelevant species and phases and set
mestability constraints, then start GEM calculation of equilibrium
state.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If necessary, the standard-state thermodynamic data will be
automatically converted to temperature/ pressure of interest&nbsp;
before computing the equilibrium state using several techniques as
appropriate for soilds, gases, aqueous and surface species.&nbsp; </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using GEMS, you can simulate various mass-transfer processes and
reaction paths, such as titrations, mixing, weathering, or sequential
reactors, controlled by a "process extent" master variable(s) used in
the process simulator scripts. Results of such "process simulations"
can easily be tabulated, plotted (also at run time), copy-pasted to
other programs, or printed into text files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to the common "primal solution", i.e. equilibrium
chemical speciation, the GEM IPM algorithm always calculates a "dual
solution", i.e. chemical potentials of stoichiometry units (elements)
in equilibrium state. By comparing primal and dual solutions, it
becomes easy to retrieve pe (Eh), pH, fugacities of gases, very low
activities or concentrations of dissolved species, as well as to
estimate unknown thermodynamic properties of mixing or of end-members
in a solid solution - aqueous solution system.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, using the GEM-Selektor code will bring you all the power of
advanced chemical thermodynamic modelling, leading to high efficiency
in interpreting even complex subsurface- or hydrothermal aquatic
systems. Of course, some learning and exercise will be needed. To make
it easier, we strive to provide a help tutorial and a set of test
projects .</p>

<h3> <a name="WHATISNOT"></a>What is GEM-Selektor not?</h3>

<h4><big> </big>GEMS3 cannot replace your knowledge of physical
chemistry.</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's hardly possible to set up meaningful problems in geochemical
thermodynamic modelling and interprete results without a good basic
understanding of aquatic chemistry and chemical thermodynamics, even
though the underlying concepts are very general and quite simple.
Taking a course in the above subjects and/or reading a few good
textbooks such as (Anderson, 2005; Nordstrom and Muños, 1994; Stumm and
Morgan, 1996) would therefore be a valuable investment, helping you to
maximize the usefulness of GEMS modeling.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>GEMS3 is not a substitute for creative research.</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Geochemical thermodynamic modelling (as almost any modelling)
should be regarded as nothing else than a tool&nbsp; helping you in
interpreting your geochemical data and in reaching a deeper
understanding of how the chemical system works. As with any tool, using
GEMS3 can be either creative or a waste of time.<big> </big></p>
</blockquote>

<h4>GEMS3 cannot formulate chemical modeling problems and interpret
results.<br>

</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Very often, first GEMS3 modeling runs yield rather unexpected
results, urging a re-consideration of some concepts or assumptions..
This is normal; a few more modeling iterations will soon give you much
more confidence in your data and model predictions. It makes no sense
is to start modeling just having the raw data, without a working
hypothesis to be verified; clearly, no interpretation of results is
possible in this case. GEMS3 is just a tool for checking how realistic
your ideas about the system are.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>GEMS3 cannot simulate processes in far-from-equilibrium systems.</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some natural, biological or technical systems, especially at short
time scales, exist far from equilibrium or in a transient state. In
such cases, fundamental assumptions about local and partial equilibria
cannot be applied and, therefore, methods of equilibrium chemical
thermodynamic cannot be used. Before doing any model calculations with
GEMS3 or another speciation code, first question to ask is whether the
concept of local/partial equilibrium is adequate for the system of
interest.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>GEMS3 is not a tool for plotting phase diagrams.</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Plotting phase diagrams is a popular exercise in chemical
thermodynamics in petrology or metallurgy, and in aquatic chemistry as
well. This often requires a very serious simplification of the chemical
system (to make it observable in 2D or 3D coordinate space). A number
of tools is avaialble for this purpose (Perplex, Thermocalc, PHREEQPLOT
etc.). GEMS modeling, however, is aimed at quantifying the effects of
equilibration at given (sequence of) T,P, and bulk composition in full
speciation complexity of the system, perhaps under many additional
kinetic, metastability and/or dispersity constraints. GEMS3 batch
calculations can be designed in a way that directly produces phase,
activity, or reaction-path diagrams.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>GEMS3 cannot create thermodynamic data or assess their quality.</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any chain is as strong as it's weakest link. Likewise, any
modeling result is not better than the input compositional and
thermodynamic data. In the past 30 years, a considerable progress has
been made in compilation of internally consistent thermodynamic data
bases, including those supplied as the default database with GEMS code.
However, no database covers everything relevant for all possible
applications. Therefore, it is usually necessary to extend it with the
standard-state data for some missing species or minerals, or extend T,P
correction range. Although GEMS3 provides a number of tools for
extension of the project thermodynamic database, it cannot replace an
expert in critical compilation, matching and retrieval of thermodynamic
data.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><a name="PRACTICAL_ISSUES"></a></font>Some
Practical Features of GEMS3<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
</font></h3>

In most geochemical modelling studies (except maybe simple test
examples) the user will need to extend thermodynamic database with some
new chemical species and phases, or change some thermodynamic
properties of them in a consistent way. A modeling project concept
implemented in GEMS lets the user performing such modifications
conveniently and continue thermodynamic modeling straight away: already
created records with input chemical recipes and output equilibrium
speciation will be updated or extended automatically. <br>

<br>

All input data and results of GEM calculations are automatically stored
in the modeling project data base files and nowhere else. The user can
zip her modelling project folder for back-up or to share it with
colleagues. Anyone who has (the same or newer) GEMS3 code installed on
her PC can unpack that project and run it, as the user would continue
running it on her own desktop. &nbsp;<br>

<br>

GEMS3 has a complementary structure of thermodynamic database. The
standard molar data for chemical species are kept either in
thermochemical (optionally equation-of-state) DComp format, or as
reactions defining standard molar properties of a given species via
that of the reaction and of other species involved (ReacDC format). In
both formats, many data consistency checks are performed. Data of both
formats, saved into database records, can be immediately used in GEM
calculations of chemical equilibria.<br>

<br>

Unlike command-driven or batch-input-file geochemical codes (e.g.,
PHREEQC, EQ3/6, GWB, ChemApp, Selektor-C, HCh), GEM-Selektor is an
interactive modular package in which computational modules share data
objects in memory, manipulated by the data base maintenance module.
GEMS is written in C/C++ and has a modern multi-document
mouse-menu-driven GUI (graphical user's interface) based on the Qt GUI
Toolkit, which also provides GEMS with cross-platform portability: The
source code of GEMS can be compiled and executed on most Intel-based
Linux/Unix, Windows, and Mac OS X desktop platforms. &nbsp;<br>

<br>

In GEM-Selektor, no batch files with input data are necessary. The
program operation is fully interactive, controlled by mouse clicking on
toolbar icons or menu items, selecting record keys from lists, or
entering data directly into spreadsheet-like screen forms. Your entered
or calculated data is automatically stored in the project data base,
where it is kept accessible for subsequent calculations or data
sampling, plotting or exporting. This interactive functionality makes
the work flow of geochemical modeling more efficient than ever before. <br>

<br>

Almost all kinds of data accessible in GEM-Selektor windows using the
data object labels can be printed into ASCII text files using the
simple print formatting scripts. A collection of template printing
scripts is provided for the user' convenience; all scripts can easily
be customized and saved into your project data base. The data in module
window pages can also be copy-pasted to/from most other spreadsheet or
text editing programs. Some results of computations can also be
exported into csv and VTK format files.<br>

<br>

GEM-Selektor GUI provides the user with a context-sensitive hypertext
runtime help. In most cases, the tooltips (popping up upon hovering the
cursor over almost every button or data field) are sufficient. Direct
access to separate HelpWindow with documentation is possible from any
dialog, screen form, and even a single data field cell on any screen
form. The HelpWindow has the industry-standard browsing and search
functionality. <br>

<br>

GEM-Selektor numerical kernel GEMS3K implements an Interior Points
Method (IPM) module for non-linear minimization of total Gibbs energy
of the heterogeneous multi-phase chemical system,
with improved accuracy, mass balance precision, convergence, speed, and
extended input data diagnostics to meet the needs of the
reactive-transport modelling applications in performance assessment of
radioactive waste disposal,&nbsp; aquatic chemistry, and
hydrogeochemistry. The IPM module uses fast and efficient linear
algebra solvers from the JAMA C++ TNT package from NIST.<br>

<br>

The GEMS3K standalone program implementing the enhanced GEM IPM
algorithm is now available open-source from this web site under the
LGPL v.3 license. GEMS3K has no GUI and can read/write input/output
data from/to text files, as well as exchange the data in computer
memory. It can also interpolate thermodynamic data for chemical species
for changing temperature and/or pressure. The purpose of GEMS3K is to
facilitate and promote development of coupled codes for modelling
reactive mass transport using the "operator splitting" approach with
GEM chemical equilibria solver. GEMS3K C/C++ code is small, fast, and
meets all requirements of such coupled codes including MPI
parallelization and high-performance computing for realistic 2D or 3D
transport simulations.&nbsp;
