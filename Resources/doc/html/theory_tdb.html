<h3><a name="GHS-DEF"></a>1. Standard molar thermodynamic functions of
substances (dependent components)<br>
</h3>


<p>The GEM algorithms [Karpov et al., 1997; 2001] require at least two
kinds of input data for each dependent component included into the
definition of chemical system. (i) Main input is the formal (elemental)
stoichiometry, expressed as a&nbsp; <a href="g_useref.html#FORMULA">formula</a>
in either <a href="gm_dcomp.html#DCform"><tt>DCform</tt></a> or <a href="gm_reacdc.html#RDform"><tt>RDform</tt></a> fields of <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a> or <a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a>
window, respectively. (ii) The molar (partial molal) apparent Gibbs
energy function g<sub>(T,P) </sub>at temperature and pressure of
interest. Optionally, the molar (partial molal) volume V<sub>(T,P) </sub>&nbsp;is
needed at input because, if provided for all DCs, it allows to
calculate the total volume of the system and each phase at equilibrium.
</p>


<p>Other molar thermodynamic functions of DCs such as the molar
(partial molal)
apparent enthalpy function i<sub>(T,P)</sub>, entropy S<sub>(T,P)</sub>,
internal
energy U<sub>(T,P)</sub>, Helmholtz energy F<sub>(T,P)</sub> are needed
for
minimization of five other thermodynamic potentials than Gibbs energy
[cf.
Karpov et al., 2002]. This parametric minimization is not available in
GEM-Selektor
version 2-PSI, but we expect implementing it in the forthcoming major
versions.
</p>


<p>The molar entropy S<sup>o</sup><sub>298</sub> (or enthalpy H<sup>o</sup><sub>298</sub>)
and isobaric heat capacity Cp<sub>298</sub> functions of a substance at
reference temperature Tr (25 <sup>o</sup>C or 298.15 K) and pressure
Pr (1
bar) are in any case needed for performing temperature corrections for
the
g<sub>(T,P)</sub> function; the standard molar volume V<sup>o</sup><sub>298</sub>
and its change with temperature and pressure is needed for pressure
correction of&nbsp; g<sub>(T,P)</sub>. Three "energy" standard molar
functions G<sup>o</sup><sub>298</sub>, H<sup>o</sup><sub>298</sub> and S<sup>o</sup><sub>298</sub>
depend on each other (see below), so, in fact, it is enough to provide
any two of them. </p>


&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>


<h4><a name="GHS_CROSS_CHECK"></a>1.1. Cross-Checking Procedure for G<sup>o</sup><sub>Tr</sub>
, H<sup>o</sup><sub>Tr</sub> and S<sup>o</sup><sub>Tr</sub></h4>


The standard molar (partial molal) apparent Gibbs energy function&nbsp;
g<sup>o</sup><sub>Tr</sub> of a species in its standard state at
reference templerature Tr (25 <sup>o</sup>C) and pressure Pr (1
bar),&nbsp; is by convention numerically equal to Gibbs energy of
formation of this compound at Tr, Pr (G<sup>o</sup><sub>f,Tr</sub>)
from chemical elements in their respective standard states (including
electrical charge).
<p>The same holds for the apparent molar (partial molal) ehthalpy i<sup>o</sup><sub>Tr</sub>
and entahlpy of formation H<sup>o</sup><sub>f,Tr</sub>. However, the
molar (partial molal) entropy s<sup>o</sup><sub>Tr</sub> is taken here
numerically equal to the absolute, or third-law entropy S<sup>o</sup><sub>a,Tr</sub>,
whereas the entropy of formation S<sup>o</sup><sub>f,Tr</sub>&nbsp;
is&nbsp; </p>


<p>G<sup>o</sup><sub>f,Tr</sub> = H<sup>o</sup><sub>f,Tr</sub> -
Tr&nbsp; S<sup>o</sup><sub>f,Tr</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; (1). </p>


<p>Absolute entropy is related to the entropy of formation by </p>


<p>S<sup>o</sup><sub>f,Tr</sub> = S<sup>o</sup><sub>a,Tr</sub> - <b>sum</b><sub>i</sub>(ai
S<sup>o</sup><sub>a,i</sub>)
, i =
1,...,N&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(2), </p>


<p>where S<sup>o</sup><sub>a,i</sub> stands for the absolute entropy of
i-th chemical element in standard state at Tr, ai is a stoichiometry
coefficient of i-th element in the formula of the compound (i.e. ai is
the number of moles of element per one mole of the compound). Equations
(1) and (2) can be combined, permitting calculation of any one of
values G<sup>o</sup><sub>Tr</sub>, H<sup>o</sup><sub>Tr</sub> and S<sup>o</sup><sub>Tr</sub>
from the two
other known (S<sup>o</sup><sub>a,i</sub> values for elements are
provided
in the <a href="gm_icomp.html">IComp</a> records). For example, the
molar
enthalpy is calculated as &nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>H<sup>o</sup><sub>Tr</sub> = G<sup>o</sup><sub>Tr</sub> + Tr (S<sup>o</sup><sub>Tr</sub>
- <b>sum</b><sub>i</sub>(ai S<sup>o</sup><sub>a,i</sub>)
), i = 1,
...
,N&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;(3). </p>


<p>This equation is also used in cross-checking procedure that can be
executed in the GEMS program when thermodynamic data for gases, solids,
or aqueous species are entered or imported into <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a>
data records. In the case when all three values are entered, the
enthalpy is
calculated from the above equation (3) and compared to the input H<sup>o</sup><sub>Tr</sub>
value: </p>


<p><b>dev(</b>H<sup>o</sup>) = | H<sup>o</sup><sub>Tr</sub>(input) - H<sup>o</sup><sub>Tr</sub>(calculated)
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(4). </p>


<p>The program will issue a warning message if <b>dev</b>(H<sup>o</sup>)
&gt;
57 J mol<sup>-1</sup> and give the user a choice - either to accept
the&nbsp;
H<sup>o</sup><sub>Tr</sub>(calculated) value or to check other input
parameters.
In this way, the internal data consistency is maintained.&nbsp;</p>

</p>


<h3><a name="TP-CORR-DEF"></a>2. Temperature and pressure corrections
(DComp data format)</h3>


<p>The standard molar properties of dependent components must be
corrected from reference (Tr, Pr) to temperature and pressure of
interest (T,P) before using them in GEM calculations of chemical
equilibria. Depending on the phase state and nature of dependent
components, such corrections can be performed using different
techniques, each with its own additional input data. Some common
methods are implemented and incorporated into the GEMS code. They
will be selected and executed automatically according to the <a href="gm_dcomp.html#TPcMod_0">method codes</a> set during creation or
re-making of a <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a> record. &nbsp; </p>


&nbsp;<br>


<h4><a name="TPCORR-COMMON"></a> 2.1. Common techniques for condensed
substances and ideal gases</h4>


<p>In the majority of GEM-based modelling codes or programs for
plotting phase
equilibrium diagrams, temperature corrections for standard molar
properties of minerals, melt components, non-electrolyte liquids and
gases are performed using the integration of heat capacity function Cp
= f(T) over one or more temperature intervals. The&nbsp;Cp = f(T)
function is represented by several empirically fitted coefficients at
different powers of absolute temperature T. One should be aware that,
in general, such coefficients are not applicable outside of their
temperature intervals and therefore, the extrapolated values of g<sup>o</sup><sub>T</sub>
should not be used in calculation of chemical equilibria as large
errors may be introduced. The GEMS code will automatically mark such
"extrapolated" data with an <big><tt>'e'</tt></big> character, visible
in the <a href="gems_bcc.html#TPmark"><tt>TPmark</tt></a> column
on the "Thermodynamic Data" window, which is accessible through the <a href="gems_bcc.html">"Single Equilibrium System" dialog.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>


<p>Details on temperature corrections using&nbsp;Cp = f(T) dependences
can be found in the file&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">T-corrections.pdf</span>.</span>&nbsp;
&nbsp; </p>


<p>At elevated pressures, thermodynamic data (g<sup>o</sup><sub>T</sub>
values) must be corrected from the reference pressure Pr = 1 bar to
pressure of interest. For condensed substances (solids, liquids), the
minimum required information is the standard molar (partial molal)
volume at Pr, Tr; over moderate temperature and pressure intervals, the
molar volume can be assumed constant. However, at wider intervals, the
thermal expansion and compressibility of substances must be considered.
There is a variety of approaches for pressure corrections using
variable molar volume V<sub>(T,P)</sub> = f(T,P). Simpler techniques,
based on empirical coefficients of the V = f(T,P) dependence, &nbsp;are
being replaced at present by an extrapolatable method based on the
Birch-Murnaghan equation of state. </p>


<p>In the file&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">P-corrections.pdf</span>,
you can find details on pressure corrections as implemented in the GEMS
code. The pressure corrections related to data for minerals from a
companion M.Gottschalk's database will be described in a separate
document <u>P-corrections-MGD.pdf</u> &nbsp;(under construction). </p>


<br>


<h4> <a name="TPCORR-ADVANCED"></a>2.2. Advanced techniques (aqueous
species, gases) </h4>


<p>Molar thermodynamic properties of gases and partial molal properties
of aqueous ions and complexes strongly depend on both temperature and
pressure. Temperature corrections for pure ideal gases are made using
the Maier-Kelly coefficients or any similar form of Cp = f(T)
dependence (see above). It is also possible to regress formal Cp = f(T)
dependences for aqueous and complexes, as it has been done in some
early versions of Selektor code [Dorogokupets et al., 1988]. This
approach has a disadvantage that thermodynamic data can be corrected
only along the so-called "saturated vapor curve" &nbsp;for pure H<sub>2</sub>O
that corresponds to equilibrium partial pressures of water vapor at
temperatures up to critical point of H<sub>2</sub>O (Tcr =
374 <sup>o</sup>C, Pcr = 221 bar). At this curve, the value of
pressure P<sub>SAT</sub>
can be calculated for any temperature of interest T. </p>


<p>At present, the most widespread and practical method of
temperature/pressure corrections of partial molal properties of aqueous
species is based on the revised Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers equation of
state (HKF EoS) and the database of its coefficients, provided in the <a href="http://eps.wustl.edu/geopig/">SLOP98</a> data file [<a href="g_litref.html#%5B1997SHO/SAS%5D">1997SHO/SAS</a> and references
therein]. All the necessary subroutines from the SUPCRT92 code
[1992JOH/OEL] have been added to the GEM-Selektor code to perform T,P
corrections using the HKF EoS coefficients kept in the DComp record
format. Details on these calculations can be found in a separate
document <u>TP-corrections-HKF.pdf</u> (to be provided) or in papers
by H.Helgeson and co-workers. </p>


<p>Pressure corrections for molar thermodynamic properties of non-ideal
gases require knowledge of their EoS parameters. The molar volume of
pure ideal gas can be found at any temperature of interest from the
ideal gas law:
&nbsp;PV = RT, where R = 8.31451 J/K/mol is the universal gas constant.
As the standard state for gases is defined at Pr = 1 bar at any T, it
follows
the pressure correction for the molar properties of any pure ideal gas
will
be g<sub>(T,P)</sub> = g<sup>o</sup><sub>T</sub> + RT ln P. The RT ln P
term is actually included into the expressions for primal chemical
potentials
calculated in the GEM algorithm (cf. [Karpov et al., 1997; 2002].&nbsp;
</p>


<p>However, especially at moderate temperatures and elevated pressures,
gases show strongly non-ideal behavior. Molar volumes of pure gases
deviate from
the ideal gas lew; there are also complex non-ideal effects of mixing
in
multi-component fluids . The non-ideality of pure gases can be
expressed using the concept of fugacity via the fugacity coefficient
fi:&nbsp;g<sub>(T,P)</sub> = g<sup>o</sup><sub>T</sub> + RT(ln P + ln
fi). To calculate the fugacity or the fugacity coefficient, one must
know the functional form of &nbsp;fi = f(T,P) for each gas, determined
from the experimental compressibility
data or predicted theoretically. Many such dependencies follow from
various
EoS for non-ideal gases. In the past, the fugacities of pure gases were
often calculated using the "correspondence states" theory (cf.
[Nordstrom
and Munos, 1994]), using critical parameters of gases Tcr (temperature
at
critical point), Pcr (pressure), Vcr (critical volume), and Zcr
(compressibility
factor). This calculation has also been implemented in the FGL module
of
Selektor codes&nbsp; (details in a separate document <u>TP-corrections-FGL.pdf</u>,
to be provided). Note that the FGL module is disabled in this version
of GEM-Selektor code. </p>


<p>Recently, new predictive and extrapolative EoS for gases (fluids)
have been developed, also capable of predicting mixing properties of
multi-component fluids. Such a "perturbation theory based" EoS
[Churakov and Gottschalk, 2003a,b] is implemented in the GEM-Selektor
code as a third-party contribution in connection with the companion
chemical thermodynamic database of M.Gottshalk (<span style="font-family: monospace;">http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/pb4/pg1/dataset/index.html</span>).
Details about these calculations are given in a separate document&nbsp;
<span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">TPX-corrections-CG-EoS.pdf</span>
.</p>

<h3><a name="REACDC-DEF"></a>3. Calculation of standard molar
properties of
substances via reactions (ReacDC data format)</h3>


<p> This technique is indispensable for surface- or aqueous complexes,
amorphous&nbsp; minerals or solid solution end members, isotopic forms
of
substances that cannot be described using the HKF EoS or for which the
full
set of standard molar properties is not known. </p>


<p>Usually, such dependent components form the so-called
"application-specific" extensions of thermodynamic database. By
constructing the so-called isoelectric or isocoulombic reactions,
reasonable temperature and pressure extrapolations of molar properties
of such DCs can be obtained even in cases when only
logK of reaction is known at 25 <sup>o</sup>C. </p>


<p>Simple algebraic calculations required for this purpose are
described
in the file&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">T-corrections-Reac.pdf</span>.
The ReacDC format can also be used for the fast retrieval of properies
of arbitrary reactions (in 3-term extrapolation) between chemical
species already presented in GEMS database as DComp and/or ReacDC
records.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="TPCORR-REACDC"></a>4. Calculation of <i>T,P</i>
&nbsp;corrected
molar properties for ReacDC -defined chemical species</h3>


<p>Details on temperature corrections for thermodynamic properties of
reactions and molar properties of the "new" reaction-defined species,
as well as
simple pressure corrections, can be found in the file&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
T-corrections-Reac.pdf</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This way of representing
thermodynamic properties is especially useful for some aqueous
complexes and for surface species, which cannot be described using
conventional thermochemical or EoS based methods.&nbsp; However,
pressure corrections in this case are limited to the simplest
constant-molar-volume case; for surface species, molar volumes are not
known, thus the pressure correction techniques are not available and
still have to be developed.&nbsp; </p>
