<h3> <a name="P3300"></a><tt>3.3. "Thermodynamic Database" Mode</tt></h3>


What to do if you have reached a conclusion that an aqueous complex,
two solid phases and more GCO definitions are missing in the system
profile
you worked with? Or you do not like some thermodynamic data in the
default
GEMS database and want to replace them with other numbers? This
situation
is typical in geochemical modeling and sometimes requires a lot of
effort
to resolve. In GEMS, such extensions are done quickly and easily,
although
this requires some more understanding on your side how the GEMS
thermodynamic
database is organized and maintained.
<p>Although the GEMS default thermodynamic database can be used for
solving many geochemical problems (Tutorial is under construction),
almost each
real study involving thermodynamic modeling, sooner or later, faces a
problem
of inconsistency or incompleteness of thermodynamic data. It is
therefore
important to have convenient tools to handle the data, check and match
them,
and incorporate into equilibria calculations. The tradition, however,
is
still such that most of modeling codes contain files with thermodynamic
data
from published databases but no tools to work with the data (except
using
them for speciation calculations). There are codes like SUPCRT92
(Johnson
et al., 1992) which handle the thermodynamic database, calculate
user-specified
reactions, plot them on diagrams, but they do not calculate equilibria
in
the multi-component&nbsp; multi-phase systems. Moreover, most of
speciation
programs based on the Law-of-Mass Action (LMA) algorithm (like PHREEQC
or
MINTEQA2) use thermodynamic data in the form of reaction equilibrium
constants
and their dependence on temperature and/or pressure. Thermochemical
data
should be recalculated first into logK values (e.g., as in EQ3/6) to be
used
in such codes (with considerable loss of information) which usually do
not
offer any tools for doing&nbsp; that (luckily, there are special
utility
programs PMATCH (Pearson and Avis, 1989) and PM2SEL (Dmytriyeva et al.,
1999)
for thermodynamic data matching and conversion to different
formats).&nbsp;
Programs based on GEM algorithms (e.g., ChemGeo, GIBBS, Selektor,
GEMS),
on the contrary, accept only the standard state partial molar(molal)
values
of Gibbs energy for all species, so any data represented as logK should
first
be converted to g<sup>0</sup>(T,P) value before GEM modeling
calculations.
In this case, it is not easy to extend thermodynamic database with
consistent
data for some new components if their thermochemical properties are not
well
known. Hence, the structure of GEMS database has been designed to help
in
overcoming these difficulties. </p>


<p>When you start GEMS and press the "<tt>Thermodynamic Database</tt>"
button on Main dialog, you will see a "Thermodynamic Database" dialog
window with six large buttons for entering the following data
screenforms (record types). The data types are shortly described below.
</p>


<p><a name="P33D1"></a><b><i>Independent&nbsp; Components&nbsp; (ICOMP)</i></b>
</p>


<p>The ICOMP database chain contains records defining Independent
Components (IC), symbols of <a href="#P3321">record keys</a> of which
are used in writing chemical formulae of species and in specifying
stoichiometry basis of chemical systems for calculation of equilibrium
states. As IC, chemical elements are usually considered in GEM
modeling. In addition, some isotopes, charge and volume are present in
the default database. Additional IC (like EDTA or other stable organic
ligands)can be also specified. Usage of petrogenic oxides SiO2,
Al2O3, ... as IC is not recommended (although possible) in GEMS, as it
will
require complete redefinition of thermodynamic database </p>


<p><a name="P33D2"></a><b><i>Predefined Compositions (Compos, GCO)</i></b>
</p>


<p>This chain contains definitions of bulk composition of certain
(geo)chemical objects (GCO), such as rocks, ores, natural waters,
fluids etc. Each GCO
has a unique name (identifier) in the <a href="#P3322">record key</a>
and,
regardless of specifications, is converted into numbers of moles of i<a href="#P33D1">ndependent components</a>. The GEMS code offers many
flexible and efficient <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6104">methods
for specification</a> of GCO compositions via molar, mass, volume
fractions, molality or molarity units, and absolute masses or number of
moles of IC, DC or user-defined stoichiometries. Virtually any
published composition can be represented close to its original
appearance by <a href="#P3381">creating a Compos record</a>. GCO
compositions can be referred to in definitions of chemical systems
(SysEq and PROCES records) for flexible and convenient specification of
total bulk composition. This functionality permits to set up various
mixing process simulation models in
a quite simple and powerful way. </p>


<p><a name="P33D3"></a><b><i>Dependent Components (Thermochemical),
DCOMP</i></b> </p>


<p>Records in this chain contain the standard state thermodynamic
properties of species in "thermochemical" format. Minimal information
about a species includes: the phase (standard and reference) state;
name (identifier), also in the<a href="#P3323"> record key</a>;
stoichiometry (chemical formula,
expressed in <a href="#P33D1">IC symbols</a>); <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6201">type of species</a>; standard
(partial molal) Gibbs energy of formation from IC at reference T,P;
(partial molal) molar volume, entropy and heat capacity at standard
state. DCOMP records may
contain several optional data vectors holding coefficients for various
TP
dependencies of thermodynamic properties or equations of state, used
for the
different <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6500">methods of
thermodynamic calculations</a>.
</p>


<p>DCOMP chain (as any other GEMS database chain) consists of several
files which can be <a href="#P333F2">linked</a> or unlinked anytime by
the user. Each file normally contains a number of DCOMP records
comprizing a subset of an "internally consistent" thermodynamic
dataset. In GEMS default database, two published datasets are
incorporated as "core" data: the&nbsp; <a href="http://zonvark.wustl.edu/geopig/">SUPCRT98</a> database for
aqueous species and gases (Shock et al., 1997 and references therein),
and the <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/tech-transfer/factsheets/94-061.html">USGS
thermochemical database for minerals </a>(Robie and Hemingway, 1995).
This does not imply that thermodynamic data are always consistent
between different datasets! The user should be careful in using
different datasets together and, in general, should avoid mixing of the
data from the alternative datasets (e.g., Berman,1988 and Holland &amp;
Powell, 1990) in Phase and SysEq definitions, whenever possible.
</p>


<p>By pressing the "Dependent Components (Thermochemical)" button on
the
"<tt>Thermodynamic Database</tt>" dialog, you can get into a "DComp::"
screenform.
Buttons and menu commands accessible&nbsp; in this and other
screenforms
are described <a href="#P3330">below</a>. Show any record for solid
mineral
species ('s' is the first <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6202">code</a>
in the <a href="#P3323">record key</a>) by pressing the "Show" button
and
selecting the record key from the list. The data fields (each displays
a
help line when pointed with mouse) can be edited immediately (to <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6900">edit</a>, click with left mouse
button in the data field). </p>


<p>Please, note that 0 (zero) is a meaningful number in GEMS
thermodynamic database. If a value is not known then a special "empty"
symbol has to be entered (back apostrophe `). The "P~t~" field contains
reference pressure and temperature (usually 1 bar and 25 <sup>o</sup>C).
One or more bibliographic references to sources of data are usually
specified in the "dSDref" list. Two optional vector-columns are usually
present on&nbsp; <tt>Page 2</tt>&nbsp; of the "DComp::" window:
"ai_Cp" data object contains <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6502">empirical
coefficients</a> of temperature dependence of heat capacity Cp = f(T),
and "Cp_int" field shows temperature range (in centigrade) of
applicability of Cp = f(T) coefficients. The first five coefficients
exactly correspond to Haas-Fisher form of Cp = f(T) equation, adopted
in many references. More than one equation can be specified for one
mineral (under construction). Compressibility / expandability data can
also be entered, either directly into "BetAlp" fields, or as optional
coefficients of V = f(T,P) equation. Which optional data will be
entered and how they will
be used in thermodynamic calculations is defined by the <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6504">method codes</a> accessible on <a href="#P333R2">remake</a> of DCOMP records.&nbsp; For instance, the
most common&nbsp; "CSN" method codes tell that the standard integration
over temperature intervals using Cp = f(T) equation coefficients should
be performed (see Nordstrom
and&nbsp; Munoz, 1994). </p>


<p>The same thermochemical format is used for gases. The only
difference
is that an optional "CritPg" vector can be specified for keeping
critical
parameters for this gas/liquid for calculation of gas fugacities at
elevated
P;T using the correspondent-state theory (under construction). </p>


<p>Third form of DCOMP records is used for aqueous ions and complexes
from SUPCRT dataset (Johnson et al., 1992; Shock et al., 1995). The
partial molal properties for such species are calculated for elevated
T&lt;1000 <sup>o</sup>C and P&lt;5000 bar using the revised HKF EOS
(Helgeson- Kirkham- Flowers
equation of state). Corresponding subroutines adapted from SUPCRT92
code
(Johnson ea, 1992) are built into GEMS. As an example, pick up a record
keyed
"a:WS+6:SO4-2:sa0:" which contains the standard reference partial molal
thermodynamic
properties of sulfate ion. In "a@~" field, a default value of Kielland
ion-size
parameter for use in the built-in Debye-Hueckel equation is specified.
On<tt>
Page 2 </tt>of "DComp::" window, an "ai_HKF" vector contains <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6507">empirical parameters of HKF EOS</a>.
</p>


<p>When <a href="#P333R4">Calculate</a> button (or menu command) is
activated&nbsp; from the DComp:: window, the program performs parsing
of DC <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6030">chemical formula</a> with
calculation of gram-formula mass and charge, <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6508">cross-checking</a> of molar
properties, and (optional) calculation of heat capacity and molar
volume at reference temperature and pressure. If any problems are
encountered, various diagnostic messages will be displayed until the
data become consistent. <br>
&nbsp; </p>


<p><a name="P33D4"></a><b><i>Dependent Components (Reactions), REACDC</i></b>
</p>


<p>REACDC records are used for defining thermodynamic properties of
aqueous and surface complexes and minerals for which thermochemical
data are not
available or too uncertain. For such species, only logK of the
dissolution,
association or surface complexation reaction is usually known,
correlated
or predicted at 25 C or other temperatures. Thus, REACDC records
describes
the reaction and its properties (with certain T,P dependence). Because
GEM
algorithms can not use reactions and stability constants for
calculation
of equilibria, REACDC record also provides a set of standard (partial
molal)
thermodynamic properties for a <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6501">"new"
species</a>, computed from the properties of the reaction and that of
all
other species involved in the reaction. </p>


<p>The "new", reaction-defined compound, actually, gives name to the
reaction and to the REACDC <a href="#P3324">record key</a>.
Thermodynamic properties of this compound are automatically maintained
consistent to other species involved into the reaction at all T,P.
These "involved" species must already exist in the database as either <a href="#P33D3">DCOMP</a> or REACDC records: REACDC definition can refer
to other REACDC records, thus forming a "reaction chain" (up to seven
levels of recursion are supported). Any reaction chain always
terminates with a reaction which refers to DCOMP record keys only.
There are several <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6500">methods of
calculation</a> of thermodynamic properties of reaction-defined species
<a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6500">at elevated T,P</a>. </p>


<p>REACDC facility is a unique feature of GEMS, to our knowledge not
yet
available in other codes for equilibria calculations or thermodynamic
databases.
Accordingly, GEMS database is the first "hybrid" thermodynamic database
in
a sense that thermochemical data and reactions are used together for
any
kind of geochemical modeling and consistency is maintained. Large
consistent
thermodynamic datasets (e.g., for surface complexation or aqueous
speciation)
can be developed using REACDC and reaction logK values at 1 bar 25 <sup>o</sup>C
using the so-called "isocoulombic reactions approach", believed to
provide
good extrapolation of logK up to 250-300 <sup>o</sup>C (Gu et al.,
1994).
For instance, the cation exchange reaction CaCO<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup>
+
Cd<sup>+2</sup> = Ca<sup>+2</sup> + CdCO<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup> can be
used
for determining properties of CdCO<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup> aqueous
complex
from the&nbsp; properties of Cd and Ca ions and CaCO<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup>
complex, available from the SUPCRT92 dataset. The reaction is
isocoulombic
because equal number of equal charges compensate on both sides. This is
a
one-term temperature extrapolation because only logK<sub>298</sub> is
specified,
thus dGr = dHr = const, dSr = 0 and dCpr = 0 at all temperatures. This
reaction
provides a much better temperature extrapolation than a corresponding
association reaction (Cd<sup>+2</sup> + CO<sub>3</sub><sup>-2</sup> =
CdCO<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup>) because it actually correlates properties
of CdCO<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup> complex with those of a similar species
CaCO<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup>. </p>


<p>To build a reaction in REACDC format, just use "<a href="#P333R3">Create</a>"
or "<a href="#P333R2">Remake</a>" menu commands, and do not skip
reorganization of the record. The program will display record key
templates and lists where you should mark all species involved in the
reaction except the new one (which must always be the last in the
REACDC species list). Then enter the name and
chemical formula of the new species, and fill in a vector of
stoichiometry coefficients for species involved in the reaction (to the
right of record key list).&nbsp; Keep in mind a convention that
stoichiometry coefficients of reactants are negative, and those of
products - positive real numbers. Each of the vector-rows for standard
state properties contains three cells instead of two as in DCOMP
window. Each first cell describes a change of the
respective property in the reaction. The second cell (except that in
"K^s"
vector) is value of the property for the "new" (last) species of the
reaction.
Third cell display absolute uncertainty of this property of the new
component,
except K^s[2], where uncertainty of logK (K^s[1]) is stored, if known.
Fill
in the known data for the reaction and type "Empty" values (back
apostroph
`) in the other data fields. Press "Calculate" button or menu command
for
calculation and cross-checking of the REACDC data (diagnostic messages
nay
appear if there are problems with the input data). </p>


<p>On<tt> Page 2 </tt>of ReacDC window, three column-vectors usually
appear. "Tc_int" and "P_int" input fields show temperature and pressure
intervals of applicability of this REACDC definition; "a_pKT"&nbsp;
vector contains <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6503">empirical
coefficients</a> of logK = f(T) equation (in most cases calculated
automatically). Which exactly calculations are to be performed and
which input data to be used is defined by the <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6500">method codes</a> which can be
changed in <a href="#P333R2">Remake</a> mode configuration window
only. </p>


<p>(Quasi)-isocoulombic extrapolations n the form of REACDC definitions
are used in GEMS to represent thermodynamic properties of surface
complexes (Kulik, 1999). This is probably the optimal way at the moment
because there is still not much data accumulated on temperature and
pressure dependence of adsorption and ion exchange. </p>


<p><a name="P33D5"></a><b><i>Dependent Components (T.P Dependencies),
RTPARM</i></b> </p>


<p>When thermodynamic data are entered into <a href="#P33D3">DCOMP</a>
records, or new <a href="#P33D4">REACDC</a> definitions are
constructed, misprints and errors can be introduced. Some of them are
automatically detected by DCOMP
/ REACDC subroutines, i.e. such errors as incomplete or inconsistent
standard
state data, wrong formula stoichiometry, incorrect charge; the
corresponding diagnostic messages are then issued. Some other errors
can be detected only when a series of thermodynamic data for varying
T,P&nbsp; is computed and plotted on graphs. Thus, the RTPARM data
structure and (graphic) screen form are provided for facilitating the
process of "debugging"&nbsp; thermodynamic data and their T,P
dependencies for individual species. RTPARM module takes the input data
from DCOMP or REACDC record with the same four first fields as in the <a href="#P3325">RTPARM record key</a> (the <a href="#P3360">override
mechanism</a> does not apply to RTPARM). </p>


<p>Several RTPARM records can be created for one DCOMP or REACDC
record,
and up to four such records can be plotted together on graphs, e.g.,
for
comparison of different temperature extrapolations. The RTPARM
function,
taken together with flexibility of DCOMP and REACDC definitions
implemented
in GEMS, provides a new level of matching and user's extension of
thermodynamic
database, and can save a lot of time and effort in putting together
various
data needed for modeling systems of environmental geochemical interest.
Since
the same DCthermo() and RCthermo() routines are used in both RTPARM and
<a href="#P3250">System Profile</a> calculations, the tests done by
RTPARM will
make you confident that nothing unexpected can happen with
thermodynamic data
during calculation of equilibria at non-ambient temperatures and
pressures. </p>


<p>As usual, new RTPARM calculations are performed in GEMS by creating
new records. In a Remake configuration window (invoked by <a href="#P333R2">Remake</a> or <a href="#P333R3">Create</a> commands),
the user can specify how many
points for temperature and pressure will be calculated, which
thermodynamic
data collected and how they will be displayed on four plots. This is
done
using flags and switches (equipped with help messages popping up at
mouse
pointer, as usual). After pressing OK, the RTPARM screenform appears
again,
there minimum, maximum temperature-pressure and their increments can be
specified if different from default (0 to 375 <sup>o</sup>C in 15 <sup>o</sup>C
increments at P<sub>SAT</sub>). </p>


<p>Calculations are performed&nbsp; with <a href="#P333R4">Calculate</a>
command; when finished, up to four graphs are displayed on <tt>"Record"
"<a href="#P333R8">Plot</a>"</tt> menu command and can be <a href="#P3290">customized</a> as in <a href="#P3280">GTDEMO</a>
record. <br>
The calculated data can also be printed into a text file using a <tt>"Record"
"<a href="#P333R9">Print</a>" </tt>command </p>


<p><a name="P33D6"></a><b><i>Definitions of Phases (PHASE)</i></b> </p>


<p>Design of GEMS database requires that each (even single-component)
phase which may appear at equilibrium state is described in a separate
PHASE record, with (unique) phase name appearing in third field of <a href="#P3326">Phase record key</a>. </p>


<p><a href="#P33D3">DCOMP</a> or <a href="#P33D4">REACDC</a>
definitions
do not contain all parameters needed to calculate equilibria involving
multi-component phases. In fact, such data as description of the
non-ideal behavior is valid for a particular model of a multi-component
phase only, and alternative representations of such phases are
possible. The flexible PHASE data structure permits to describe a large
variety of crystalline and dispersed, liquid and gaseous, adsorption
and ion-exchange ideal or non-ideal phases which may occur in different
(geo)chemical systems. </p>


<p>In GEMS, two kinds of multi-component phases are&nbsp; considered:
"symmetric" and "asymmetric". In symmetric phases (gas mixture, ideal
liquid or solid solution), concentrations, activities and activity
coefficients of all components are treated in the "rational", mole
fraction scale. Asymmetric phases (aqueous solution, sorption phases)
differ in that there is always a "solvent" or "sorbent"&nbsp;
treated in mole-fraction scale, and the rest of species - "solutes" or
"sorbates"
are considered in "practical" (e.g. molality or surface concentration)
scales,
with concentrations being normalized to the quantity of
"solvent"/"sorbent"
rather than to the whole phase. </p>


<p>Most minerals occurring in real rocks, ores, soils and sediments are
actually multi-component mixtures, although just a few of them behave
as ideal solid solutions in TPb range of geochemical interest.
Stability of many rock-forming minerals can be described as binary,
ternary, quaternary, ... symmetric or asymmetric non-ideal solutions
with "pure composition" end-members. There are many possible
mathematical representations of such non-ideality models, depending on
the underlying formalism (Margules or Guggenheim equations), number of
end-members, number of mixing sites and other assumptions. There are
also several alternative approaches to calcualtion of activity
coefficients of aqueous electrolyte species (e.g., Debye-Huckel,
Pitzer, Bronsted-Guggenheim). It is therefore hardly possible to
provide all the built-in subroutines for aqueous or solid solution
models which might be requested by (geo)chemists. In GEMS, the user can
write almost any kind of the non-ideality model as a
<a href="#P4000">Math Script</a> text stored in PHASE definition
record. This
text should provide equations for calculation of activity coefficients
for
all end-members. Before calculation of equilibria, the Math Script
expressions are extracted from PHASE records and translated into the
internal code. At each iteration of IPM algorithm, this code is
automatically executed by GammaCalc() module to provide new values of
activity coefficients from values of mole fractions and other
parameters of the non-ideal phases obtained at previous iteration. To
simplify writing of Math Scripts equations in PHASE definitions, a <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6610">special set of data object labels</a>
is available; the dimensions and pointers of them are reset separately
for each phase at each IPM iteration. Which calculations should be
performed and
where the input data should be stored is specified on remake of PHASE
records
in the <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6400">codes for non-ideality
model
types</a>. </p>


<p><a href="#P333R3">Creating</a> definitions of single-component
condensed phases is by far the simplest task because such a definition
does not include any math script equations and refers only to one
species (the <a href="#P3360">override mechanism </a>applies for
loading DCOMP/REACDC data attached to Phase definitions). In a Remake
configuration window which appears after the new <a href="#P3326">Phase
record key</a> is specified, check that "NNNNNN" is entered in fields
with <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6400">codes for non-ideality
model types</a>,&nbsp; and&nbsp; either of "l", "s" or
"d" code stays in the <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6301">phase
class field</a>., and press <tt>OK</tt>. Then select only one species
from either DCOMP or REACDC
record lists that appear. Finally, type in the phase name and check
that
"O" code is present in the <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6201">"Species
Class"</a> field. Save the new phase definition into one of your
profile
extension database files. </p>


<p>Dispersed phases differ from crystalline ones in that the default
specific surface area and surface energy in water must be specified in
the respective fields on <tt>Phase::</tt> window. For calculations of
equilibria in aquatic systems, these two values are multiplied to give
a Freundlich - Ostwald
correction to the standard state chemical potential (Parks, 1990). </p>


<p>Definitions for ideal symmetric mixtures (gaseous, liquid and solid
solutions) are created much in a similar way, with the following
differences: "INNINN" is entered in fields with <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6400">codes for non-ideality model types</a>;
several species are selected from REACDC and DCOMP record lists; "I"
code is present in the <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6201">"Species
Class"</a> list for all species. </p>


<p>Definitions of the non-ideal mixtures require more work - first on
Remake specifications for the proper selection of <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6400">codes for non-ideality model types</a>,
allocation of optional arrays for coefficients of the non-ideal
solution model,
and second - for typing in and debugging <a href="#P4000">Math Scritps</a>
with equations for calculation of the activity coefficients. This is a
job for experienced users; some examples of such scripts are provided <a href="#P4600">below</a>.&nbsp; Such scripts cannot be debugged when
PHASE record is "calculated"; the scripts will be translated and
executed only during
<a href="#P3250">calculation of equilibrium states</a> (with error
messages
if something goes wrong). </p>


<p>The (non-ideal) aqueous solution phase must always be present in any
aquatic system. In GEMS, many PHASE records defining aqueous solutions
may be created and stored in the database, but only one such definition
can be included into
the <a href="#P3400">System Profile </a>record, and usually it is
created automatically for usage of the built-in function for
Debye-Huckel equation in third approximation, valid to about unimolal
ionic strength. Kielland ion-size
parameters in this case are collected automatically from <a href="#P33D3">DCOMP</a> or <a href="#P33D4">REACDC</a> records. If
you create a specific definition of aqueous phase (e.g. with Davies or
Pitzer equations), make sure that in the <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6201">"Species Class"</a> list,
water-solvent is assigned "W", hydrogen ion "T" and all other species
"S" codes. </p>


<p>Another kind of Phase definitions requiring more work is sorption
phase. Creating it first type in a number of surface types in Remake
configuration window (1 to 6, zero by default). Check on also several
optional arrays
for keeping input adsorption parameters (area fractions of surface
types,
maximum site density, capacitances, SAT model codes). Then select
suface
species from REACDC list and sorbent species from DCOMP or REACDC
lists.
For multi- surface- type sorption models, make sure that&nbsp; proper
codes
are given&nbsp; in the <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6201">"Species
Class"</a>
list for inner- and outer-sphere surface complexes and sorbent
end-members.
Check also that the EDL models are properly specified and the non-zero
number
for specific surface area is provided (it can be changed later on in
System
definition if necessary).&nbsp; Theoretical aspects of sorption
medeling
wuth GEMS are given elsewhere (Kulik, 1995, 1998, 1999a,b; Kulik and
Peretyashko,
in prep.). <br>

<h4> <a name="P3310"></a><tt>3.3.1. File System Structure of
GEM-Selektor Database</tt></h4>


The GEMS database consists of two parts: the <i><u><a href="#P3300">thermodynamic
database</a></u></i> where all the data for independent components,
species and phases is stored, and the <i><u>systems database</u></i>
where the user's definitions of chemical systems and processes with the
results of model calculations are kept. A difference between them is
that the whole systems database is user-specific, belongs only to the
user who created it, and exists in his&nbsp; <tt>~/GEMS/profiles</tt>&nbsp;
directory, whereas the thermodynamic database mainly resides in the <i>core
database</i> directory <tt>/usr/lib/gems/DB.default</tt> , shared by
all users, and only the extensions of thermodynamic data or
compositions that the user have made for constructing his models are
stored
in his home directory.&nbsp; The default thermodynamic database is
write-protected
for normal GEMS users - this is important for safety reasons
(especially
if several users work on the same computer); it also provides a common
basis
which provides compatibility between the <a href="#P3400">system
profiles</a>,
even created by different users in different countries. <br>

<h4> <a name="P3340"></a><tt>3.3.4. The Default Thermodynamic Database</tt></h4>


The default thermodynamic database is located in<tt>
/usr/lib/gems/DB.default </tt>directory and is write-protected for all
users except the GEMS administrator (a developer who is responsible for
maintaining the default database and help
system). The default thermodynamic database of GEMS is subdivided into
a
number of <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6700">binary link files</a>
according to the <a href="#P3300">record type </a>(first part of file
name); the <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6800">stoichiometry sector </a>(second
part of file name); and the phase state (optional, third part of file
name). The concept and layout of stoichiometry sectors has been
designed in an effort to find a practical compromise, based on the
developer's experience in setting up geochemical modeling systems. It
would be equally inconvenient to have either one (very big) database
file per data type or a collection of all data-type
files for each independent component.
<p>The&nbsp; <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6810"><tt><font size="+2">major</font></tt>
stoichiometry sector</a>&nbsp; is of special importance in GEMS
thermodynamic database. First, a basis of 21 chemical element included
into this sector&nbsp; (with a considerable collection of relevant
aqueous species and minerals
for each element) alone permits to set up and solve a very large
variety
of chemical systems of interest in Earth sciences.&nbsp; Second, the
files
from this sector (at least for aqueous species and gases) in most cases
must
be linked together with the files from other sectors (e.g., <tt><font size="+2"><a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6820">h_metals</a></font></tt>)
to provide water-solvent, main electrolytes, ligands and ligand-forming
elements.
However, if you are concerned with only one or two metals (not present
in
the <tt><font size="+1">major</font></tt> sector files) then it might
be
more convenient just to copy the respective independent, dependent
components,
compositions and mineral phases into your system <a href="#P3350">profile
extension database</a> files, having them linked to the major sector
files
only. </p>


<h4> <a name="P3350"></a><tt>3.3.5. The User's Profile Database
Extensions</tt></h4>


In GEMS program package, chemical equilibria can be computed only in
the framework of the user's <a href="#P3400">system profile</a>.&nbsp;
When
a new system profile&nbsp; named &lt;<tt>pname</tt>&gt; is
created,&nbsp;
the program automatically creates a directory&nbsp; <tt>~/GEMS/profiles/</tt>&lt;<tt>pname</tt>&gt;
and a collection of empty database files of all data types&nbsp; with
names&nbsp; like&nbsp; &lt;<tt>datatype</tt>&gt;.&lt;<tt>pname</tt>&gt;.<tt>ndx</tt>&nbsp;
and &lt;<tt>datatype</tt>&gt;.&lt;<tt>pname</tt>&gt;.<tt>pdb</tt>.&nbsp;
These files are than automatically linked to file configuration saved
within the system profile record into a file <tt>~/GEMS/profiles/</tt>&lt;<tt>pname</tt>&gt;/<tt>profil</tt>.&lt;<tt>pname</tt>&gt;.<tt>pdb.
</tt>All changes, additions and results done by the user will be stored
only into database files in this directory and nowhere else. This
design
has many advantages, one of which is that you can easily backup your
work
on a praticular class of model systems, install it on another PC (where
GEMS is installed) or send to your colleague.
<p>To back up your profile, we recommend to go into the&nbsp; <tt>~/GEMS/profiles
</tt>directory using Midnight Commander or the following command
line:&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>cd /home/&lt;yourname&gt;/GEMS/profiles&nbsp;
Enter</tt>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then type the
following Unix shell command: </p>


<p><tt>tar cv /&lt;pname&gt; | bzip2 &gt;
&lt;yourname&gt;.&lt;pname&gt;.&lt;date&gt;.tar.bz2&nbsp; Enter</tt> </p>


<p>This command will call <tt>tar</tt> program to pack all files from
your profile directory into a <tt>.tar </tt>archive and compress it
with <tt>bzip2</tt> program. Then copy the resulting file&nbsp; <tt>&lt;yourname&gt;.&lt;pname&gt;.&lt;date&gt;.tar.bz2
</tt>wherever necessary.&nbsp; To unpack and restore the files, the
easiest way is to use Midnight Commander as it can dive into such
archives like into normal directories, and you can simply select the
files you need and copy them wherever you need. </p>


<h4> <a name="P3360"></a><tt>3.3.6. The Override Mechanism for Default
Species and Phases</tt></h4>


A first typical case (especially with experienced modellers) is when
the user does not like thermodynamic data for some species or minerals
provided in the <a href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6700">default database</a>
(which
is just one of several alternative choices of published thermodynamic
datasets), but the corresponding record cannot because of write
protection. Of course, you can create a new DCOMP or REACDC record with
different name for those species and type in your favorite numbers;
after the system profile is open next time, you should not forget to
switch off the "primary" species from the SysEq lists. But we
offer&nbsp; a more elegant way in GEMS: <i>the override mechanism of
record selection, </i>which applies to lists of record keys in
REACDC, PHASE and Profile/SysEq data structures.
<p>In GEMS database, structurized <a href="#P3320">record key formats</a>
are supported.&nbsp; For instance, DCOMP and REACDC record key formats
are the same and include four fields - phase state, group, species
name, and comment
(dataset code). The primary idea was to keep long lists of DC record
keys
in a well-structurized way as the database chain index is
alphabetically sorted,
so that aqueous species are first, gases go next, and minerals at the
end.
Within aqueous species list, the group name (second field) usually
refers
to metal cation or ligand, so all complexes of a given metal are
conveniently held together in the lists. Actually, the species name is
the most important because it may appear in the (case sensitive) <a href="#P4000">Math Scripts</a> before <a href="#P4500">pre-processing</a>.
The fourth field serves to indicate the original dataset from where the
data were taken and (optionally) the uncertainty
grade. </p>


<p>The override mechanism consists in that the last field of the record
key is actually ignored when the records are loaded during processing
of lists of record keys in REACDC, PHASE and Profile/SysEq data
structures. So, when the program finds more than one&nbsp; records with
the same record key fields but the last one,&nbsp; it simply takes in
the record keyed alphabetically first and ignores the rest; no warnings
are issued.&nbsp; This means that if you want to replace the DCOMP
record for, say, magnesite (<tt>s:MgCO:magnesite:rs:</tt>) from&nbsp;
the default database (<tt>rs</tt>&nbsp; in the last field refers to the
USGS database), you should simply <a href="#P333R3">create</a> a <a href="#P33D3">DCOMP</a> record with the same first three key fields
and an
alphabetically higher fourth field (e.g., <tt>s:MgCO:magnesite:my:</tt>),
type in your data and <a href="#P333R5">save</a> into your <tt>~/GEMS/profiles/&lt;pname&gt;/dcomp.&lt;phame&gt;.pdb&nbsp;</tt>
database extension file. Upon next calculation, any REACDC, PHASE
record
and Profile/SysEq structure will operate with your new data for
magnesite,
without any reconfiguration. </p>


<p>A little bit more complicated case is when you wish to replace DCOMP
data for a species but you have only reaction logK and can <a href="#P333R3">create</a><a href="#P33D4">REACDC</a> record only. This
requires to override <a href="#P33D6">PHASE</a> definition which
refers to this species: just copy it (<a href="#P333R6">Save as </a>command)
in your&nbsp; <tt>phase.&lt;pname&gt;.pdb</tt> file (with
alphabetically higher last record key field). Then <a href="#P333R2">remake</a>
the new phase definition so that it would point to your newly-created
REACDC record. Done! </p>


<h4> <a name="P3370"></a><tt>3.3.7. Adding Species and Phases to
User's Database Extenions</tt></h4>


Second typical (and very common) case is that, after some modeling
sessions, you have reached a conclusion that a mineral and an aqueous
complex,&nbsp; which most probably in reality define measured metal
concentrations, are
missing from your modeling system. There is nothing unusual - no
thermodynamic
database is complete, even the default GEMS database. It is more
important
to have the effiicient tools for extending your database and system
formulations. Such tools are at your service in GEMS package.
<p>The simplest case is adding aqueous or gaseous species if your
system
profile uses the default (automatically assembled during opening of the
profile) aqueous and gas phases. All you have to do is to collect
thermodynamic data and <a href="#P333R3">create</a> missing <a href="#P33D3">DCOMP</a> and/or&nbsp;<a href="#P33D4"> REACDC</a>
records in your database extension files. We recommend keeping up with
the style of record keys used in the default database. These new
species will be taken into all your SysEq definitions when you will
enter the "Computation of Equilibria" mode and select your profile next
time (press OK on warnings about detection of your new species). Do not
forget to re-calculate equilibria already stored in SysEq records in
your profile! </p>


<p>If you wish to add minerals to your system, first create DCOMP or
REACDC records in your database extension files for the system profile
and enter thermodynamic data (best is to show some of the existing
records and use
them as templates by applying <tt><a href="#P333R6">Save As</a></tt>
command). Then, in the same manner, create new PHASE records (single-
or multi-component phases) and remake them to point to DC records that
you have created before. The new phases and components will be
automatically inserted into System
Profile lists upon the next opening of the profile. Do not forget to
recalculate
those SysEq records where you deem the new phases to be stable! </p>


<p>One important remark about non-aqueous and non-gaseous phases and
their components: the system profile is assembled by picking up all
records available in the current PHASE database chain (with due regard
to the <a href="#P3360">override mechanism</a>). Only those DCOMP and
REACDC records will be selected that are referred to in PHASE records.
This means that some DC records in your database extension may not be
used in equilibria calculations if you (on purpose or by chance) did
not included them into PHASE record lists.
</p>


<h4> <a name="P3380"></a><tt>3.3.8. Other Modifications to User's
Database Extensions</tt></h4>


You can delete any PHASE, DCOMP, REACDC and COMPOS definitions that you
have created before if you do not need them anymore (e.g., these
species
are insignificant and phases do not appear in your equilibria). Please
be
careful with deletion of DC records referred to in definitions of solid
or
sorption phases. If the PHASE record is not deleted and not remade (to
get
rid of references to deleted DC records),&nbsp; you will not be able to
open
your system profile next time!
<p>When you create new DCOMP, REACDC or SysEq records, it is a good
scientific style to put bibliographic references in there. Any number
of fields for
such references and comments to them per record can be ordered in <a href="#P333R2">remake</a> configuration windows (usually one or two is
sufficient). In a "xSDref" field, type the reference in the <a href="#P5100">SDref</a> record key format&nbsp;
&lt;authors&gt;:&lt;year&gt;:&lt;class&gt;:&nbsp; (for example, "<tt>Nordstrom_ea:1990:chap:</tt>").&nbsp;
Put cursor in the reference key field and press <tt>F2</tt>. If the
corresponding SDref record exists in the database chain, it will appear
immediately in SDref window; if not - you can enter the ihformation
into this window and save it to your database extension file. It is
also possible to add SDref records later, using
the <a href="#P3301">Advanced Database Maintenance dialog.</a> <br>
&nbsp; </p>


<h4> <a name="P3390"></a><tt>3.3.9. Updating Existing System Profiles</tt></h4>


This is done automatically when the user enters "Computation of
Equilibria" mode of GEMS and selects a system profile from the
appearing list. If some records in thermodynamic database have been
created or depeted, a warning appears in each case. Press OK if you
need the change or Cancel if the record was inserted or deleted by
mistake (in the latter case, you will need to fix
the problem before starting your system profile again). After insertion
of
some phases and species into the system profile, it is usually
necessary to
re-calculate at least part of SysEq records produced before (and maybe,
also
some PROCES and GTDEMO definitions). It's the user's responsibility -
it
would be too heavy burden for GEMS and its developers.

<h3><b><a name="PRONSPREP"></a>How to Use the built-in Pronsprep/Parcor
procedure for estimating standard molar properties and HKF EoS
parameters of a mononuclear aqueous complex from its logK(298) value <br>
</b></h3>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="" lang="NO-BOK">This entry has been contributed by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thomas Wagner </span>(University of
Tubingen, Germany),
http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/emi/ag-markl/pages/wagner/<br>
</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="" lang="NO-BOK">Reference: Sverjensky et al. </span>(1997),
Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta, 61, 1359-1412</p>


<p><o:p></o:p>This method of estimation of the
HKF EoS (Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers equation of state) parameters for
aqueous species
does only work for simple mononuclear metal complexes, with up to 4
simple
ligands. Possible ligands are halides (F<sup>-</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, Br<sup>-</sup>,
I<sup>-</sup>), carbonates (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>),
sulfates and bisulfides (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>,
HS<sup>-</sup>). The method might be extended for phosphates (H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>,
HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>) and nitrates
(NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>),
but should be generally used with great caution. The procedure
certainly does
not work for hydroxo complexes and for polynuclear complexes of any
type.
Application of the Pronsprep and Parcor algorithms requires that the
log K of
dissociation (or formation) of the complex of interest at 25 deg C and
1 bar is
known, and that well-constrained HKF parameters for the component
simple ions
are available.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">It is important that
the log K of
formation is (1) always rewritten in terms of the dissociation reaction
and (2)
that stepwise formation constants (that are commonly reported in
experimental
papers) are recalculated to give cumulative formation constants. To
give an
example, consider the formation of the complex BiCl<sup>2+</sup> from
the
simple ions Bi<sup>3+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>. The log K of formation
is
reported as 2.2 (Kolonin and Laptev, 1982), thus, the log K of the
dissociation
reaction (BiCl<sup>2+</sup> = Bi<sup>3+</sup> + Cl<sup>-</sup>) becomes
equal to &#8211;2.2. <br>
</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">The procedure
involves two steps, namely <a href="#PRONSPREP_S1">Step (1):</a>
calculation of
the standard state molal data for the new complex from the log K of
dissociation and
standard molal data of the simple ions (Pronsprep), and <a href="#PRONSPREP_S2">Step (2)</a>:
estimation of the HKF parameters for the new aqueous complex (Parcor).</p>


<p><o:p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="PRONSPREP_S1"></a>Step
(1)</span> </o:p>requires to create a
new <a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a> record. Starting from version
2.1 of GEM-Selektor, this is efficiently facilitated by a wizard which
guides
through the ReacDC setup procedure. It is important to set the RecMod
codes (step 1
of the wizard) to "<big><span style="font-family: monospace;">K3P</span></big>",
which will later activate the Pronsprep algorithm. The
number of dependent components must be set to 3 (step 2 of the
wizard), including the new complex and the two product ions (metal plus
one
type of ligand). In the list dialog that opens after the wizard is
finished, select
these two ions (in the above example, Bi<sup>3+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>).&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>


<p><o:p></o:p>Now, Page 1 of the newly-created
ReacDC record should be visible. First you need to set the
stoichiometric
coefficients for the reaction in the&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">SC_DC</span>&nbsp; field, and remember
that this has to
be written in terms of a dissociation reaction. So in the example BiCl<sup>2+</sup>
gets a coefficient of &#8211;1 (reactant side), and both Bi<sup>3+</sup> and
Cl<sup>-</sup>
get 1 (product side). Now you have to fill the remaining entries.
Simply follow

<p>Save the record and recalculate
it. Answer the appearing questions about Pronsprep and about creating a
new DComp record with "yes". The unknown values will be
calculated and a new DComp record with the estimated standard molal
properties (but yet false HKF parameters) for the new
complex automatically created. This new DComp record will have the same
key as the original ReacDC record.&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="PRONSPREP_S2"></a>Step
(2)</span>. Now you have to switch to the
<a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a> module window. Find the newly-created
DComp record with your complex, and go to
page 2 of the record. There the TPcMod flags should be already set
automatically to the code combination "<big><span style="font-family: monospace;">HKP</span></big>" to activate the
Parcor procedure to estimate the HKF EoS coefficients. Recalculate the
record and you will see that the flags on Page 2 have changed to HKF,
and the numbers in the HKF EoS coefficients column have also changed.
Recalculate the record once more (to get correct Cp0d, V0d
and H0d values), save it, and your new estimated data are ready to be
use in modeling.</p>
