    <hr size="2" width="100%">
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(20)</span> Our previous model
      calculation shows
      that it is not possible to have all three carbonate minerals (calcite,
      siderite and rhodochrosite) at equilibrium with the atmosphere because
      carbonates of Fe and Mn are not stable at oxidizing conditions. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Besides, the calculated
      dissolved total iron concentration (log <span style="font-style: italic;">m</span>
      = -13.5) at
      equilibrium with Goethite and total manganese (log <span style="font-style: italic;">m</span>
      = -15.9) are far too low compared to
      those measured in oxic natural waters (log <span style="font-style: italic;">m</span>
      = -9 +- 1). So, it would be interesting to
      see how the system would behave if almost all "atmosphere" is removed
      and "hydromagnetite" is allowed to form together with Fe(III)
      hydroxide. <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">In GEM-Selektor, you can easily "clone"
        your
        existing system definition and change it to test improved or new
        modelling assumptions.</span> &nbsp;In the "Single Thermodynamic
      System" dialog, just click "Clone a new record from this one..." or
      execute a Record -&gt; New("Clone") menu command,
      set a new record key: "Carbonat:G:CaFeMnHypC:1:0:1:25:0:":<br>

    </p>
    <p> and press "Ok". This will immediately bring you to the Recipe Dialog.
      Change the comment line and
      modify the recipe by addition of "Aqua" to 1000 g, that of "AtmAirNit" PCO
      to 0.1
      g, and that of NaCl to 0.1 mol, as shown below. <br>
      <br>

    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>Now, click "Ok" to close the Recipe Dialog and get back to the "Single
      Thermodynamic System" window. <br>
      With mouse clicks in the "On/Off" column, by turning '+' to '-', switch
      off the "Goethite"
      and "Hematite" phases in order to exclude them from GEM calculation of
      the equilibrium state. <br>
      Then expand the "Magnetite" phase and double-click in the "G0 corr."
      column to enter 5708 (J/mol) in order to
      simulate a one logK unit (10 times) more soluble "hydromagnetite"
      (press Enter to accept
      changes):<br>

      </font><br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
      When ready, click on the "Calculate BCC and check for conficts" <img src="CalculateBCCIcon24.png"
        alt="RunBCC button" height="20" width="20"> &nbsp; and then - "Calculate
      equilibrium with GEM" &nbsp; <img src="CalculateGEMIcon24.png" alt="Run IPM button"
        height="20" width="20"> &nbsp; &nbsp; toolbar buttons.
      Accept the calculation results after the GEM IPM module has converged. You
      should see now something like that shown in a screenshot below (if you
      expand some phases):<br>
      <br>
      <img src="sshgal-9-3.png" alt="Eqstat 2" style="width: 791px; height: 623px;">
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>First
      of all, a glance into the status line tells that our new system is now
      mildly reducing (pe = -1.78) and neutral (pH = 7.08). Oxygen is now
      physically absent ( f O2
      = 1.25e-62) in a small
      "bubble" of gas phase&nbsp; made of 97% nitrogen and 3% carbon dioxide.
      All three carbonates (Calcite, Siderite, and Rhodochrosite)
      now co-exist with (hydro)magnetite. Amorphous ferrihydrite is
      undersaturated ca.
      4 orders of magnitude. <br>
    </p>
    <p>What happened with total dissolved metal
      concentrations? By clicking the "Open EqDemo window.." <img src="ShowGEMResultsIcon24.png"
        alt="Show Eqstat button" height="24" width="24"> &nbsp; toolbar button,
      we get the "EqIC" page of "EqDemo"
      window: <br>
    </p>
    <p><font size="+1"><img src="sshgal-9-4.png" alt="EqDemo IComp 2" style="width: 785px; height: 389px;">
      </font><br>
    </p>
    <p>In
      the lgm_t column, one can see that dissolved iron and manganese are
      now present in concentrations that are several orders of magnitude
      greater than
      those in the previous "open" system. By switching to the "EqDC" page,
      you can
      examine the detailed aqueous speciation of Ca, Fe and Mn.&nbsp;<br>
    </p>
    In a similar way, by "cloning" chemical
    system definitions, you can ask GEMS questions like "what happens
    if..." and immediately get answers expressed in phase assemblage and
    speciation, activities, volumes and other thermodynamic quantities.<br>
    <br>
    However, the GEMS code
    offers much more efficient tools to perform "batch" model runs, where
    many systems have to be created by a regular change in T,P, bulk
    composition, or other input data. <br>
