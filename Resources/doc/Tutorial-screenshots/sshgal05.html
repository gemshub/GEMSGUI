      The "System" module window (shown below) serves for a detailed setup of
      the model chemical system. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The "Compos" page, where you get after clicking on
      the
      "Bulk
      Composition" &nbsp;<img src="SetCompos.png" alt="SetComposButton" height="26"
        width="25"> toolbar button on "Single Thermodynamic
      System" dialog, offers you an easiest way to express your "recipe"
      to be "cooked" in the chemical equilibrium "kitchen".&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Click on the "Compos (xa_)" entry in the "Property" list at the left-hand
      side. In "Selection" list, click once on entries "Aqua", "AtmAirNit",
      "CaCO3", "FeCO3", "MnCO3" and "NaCl". These entries should remain
      highlighted, and in the "Recipe Input" area, you should see a small
      spreadsheet with all selected entries. In the "Quantity" column of that
      spreadsheet, put 300 g of water (Aqua), 300 kg of air, 1 g of CaCO3, 1 g
      of FeCO3, 1 g of MnCO3, and0.03 mol of NaCl, as show in the screen image
      below. To change Units for NaCl from grams 'g' to moles 'M', double-click
      on the entry (or select this entry and type space ' ') and select 'M' from
      the drop-down list. In the "tname" row, type a comment telling what this
      system should be in plain words. <br>
    </p>
    <p><img title="Recipe Dialog" src="sshgal-5-1.png" alt="PCO recipe dialog" style="width: 764px; height: 511px;">
    </p>
    <p>If you see the above recipe, click "Ok" to proceed. </p>
    <p>It is important to realize that entries in the "Compos (xa_)" property
      selection list are neither thermodynamic phases nor their components;
      these entries are names of Predefined Composition Objects (PCO), kept as
      "Compos" records in GEM-Selektor databases (in this case, in the
      "Carbonate" project database).</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(10)</span> PCO is a database record
      that contains elemental
      stoichiometry
      of a commonly used ingredient, such as water, air, acid, base, mineral
      solid, rock, or sediment, to put into the "equilibration
      pot" to define the bulk composition of the whole system. <br>
      Some PCO "Compos" records are provided in the GEM-Selektor default
      database. Of course, you can create in your project database as many your
      own PCO
      records
      as you wish. &nbsp;A
      Compos
      module window dispalying the "AtmAirNit" PCO is shown below (the full
      record key is "AtmAirNit:GA:1kg_dry_Nit_air_simple_:"). <br>
    </p>
    <p><img style="width: 722px; height: 316px;" title="Compos AtmAirNit" src="sshgal-5-2.png"
        alt="Compos window"> <br>
    </p>
    <p>Note that in the above screen image, the resulting PCO stoichiometry is
      normalized to 1 kg
      mass, so
      that
      adding "1 mol" of this PCO is equivalent to adding 1 kg of "normative
      air
      with decoupled nitrogen". Vice versa, adding 2 g of this predefined
      composition
      will add 1/500 of the above stoichiometry (i.e., 0.000024951 mol of C,
      0.109459034
      mol of Nit and 0.029159874 mol of O) to bulk composition of the system. <br>
      (you can get it by marking the
      PCO name in the list and pressing F7)</p>
    <hr size="2" width="100%">
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(11) Now, imagine your
        model
        system as a pot where you put all necessary ingredients, close it,
        shake,
        and keep at temperature T and pressure P &nbsp;of
        interest
        long enough to get the "stew" equilibrating into a new phase assemblage.

    <p>This is pretty similar
      to
      what happens in nature, what chemists do practically, and what the GEM
      IPM
      algorithm does mathematically. The GEM-Selektor code actually does it
      in
      two steps. <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
      </font></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>It sums input
          quantities of all ingredient stoichiometries up into a single
          vector&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">b</span>&nbsp;
          of total elemental bulk composition
          of the system (i.e. into an elemental "formula" of the whole system).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The GEM IPM module
          splits
          the <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">b</span>
          &nbsp;vector into moles of phases&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Xa</span>&nbsp;
and
          their species&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">x</span>&nbsp;
          present at equilibrium
          state.&nbsp;</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <p> The first step is done
      (without running IPM algorithm) when you click upon a "Calculate bulk
      composition" &nbsp;<img src="CalculateBCCIcon24.png" alt="RunBCC button" height="20"
        width="20"> toolbar button on the <a href="sshgal04.html#SYSTEM_DIALOG">"Single
        Thermodynamic System"</a>
      dialog. You can check the result in the "IComp" page of "System" module
      window, as shown below (vector B_). To open this window, use the "Data" "Detailed
      input recipe..." menu item. </p>
    <p><font size="+1"><img src="sshgal-5-4.png" alt="Icomp page of System window"
          style="width: 647px; height: 410px;">
        <br>
      </font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="+1"><small><br>
          </small></font></small>We see that after the Calcuclate Bulk
      Composition" operation, all
      ingredients
      (in our case, PCO additions in the recipe) are already mixed into a single
      "brew"
      (vector
      B_). <br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(12)
        To equilibrate this "brew in the pot"</span>,
      close the "System" window and click on a "Calculate equilibrium" <img src="CalculateGEMIcon24.png"
        alt="Run IPM button" height="20" width="20"> &nbsp; toolbar button.
      This will start the GEM IPM algorithm module, which displays an IPM
      Progress
      Dialog: </p>
    <p><font size="+1"><img src="sshgal-5-3.png" alt="ProgressDialog (IPM-2)" style="width: 326px; height: 498px;">
        <br>
      </font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="+1"><small><br>
          </small></font></small>In a fraction of second, the IPM Progress
      Dialog will indicate that the GEM has converged. Press on the "Accept"
      button to save the (now
      complete)
      SysEq record into your project database. <br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Congratulations!
      </span>Now, you can examine your first GEMS-calculated equilibrium; just
      proceed to the next page of this screenshot tutorial.&nbsp; <br>
