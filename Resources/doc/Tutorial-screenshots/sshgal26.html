Creating a project to model solid solution - aqueous solution systems</font></b>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">In this
section, we will create a project to calculate partitioning equilibria
in a solid-solution aqueous-solution system of alkali-earth carbonates
of Ca, Sr, Ba and Ra.
Next, some typical cases of metal partitioning between the aqueous
electrolyte
and several co-existing solid solutions will be investigated. Even
though
hypothetical, such examples also provide a quite realistic picture of
an
impact of non-ideal mixing onto partitioning, mainly because the
carbonate-
and sulphate binary solid solutions are relatively well understood (see
an
overview by P.Glynn, <i>Rev. Mineral. Geochem</i>. 2000 v. 40,
p.481-511),
and their Margules interaction parameters are known from experiments or
have
been estimated from differences in crystallographic radii of cations.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The necessary
end-members and some binary and ternary solid-solution phase
definitions are provided in the (inofficial) "Solutions" part of the
kernel GEMS-PSI database. <br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">To proceed,
start GEM-Selektor and click on the "Calculation of Equilibria" button,
then click on the "New Project" button. In the Project record key
dialog, enter two
fields of a new key </span><big><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">"</font><b><tt>RaBaSrCa:SolidSolutions:</tt></b>"</big><span
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> and click "Ok".</span><span
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
This will bring you into the "Elements Dialog" where the stoichiometry
of the project system should be set up.</span></p>
<pre wrap=""><img src="sshgal-26-3.png" alt="SSAS project"
 style="height: 575px; width: 676px;"><br><br></pre>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">It is important to select
chemical elements (by clicking on their symbols) and a "Solutions"
checkbox </font><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">in
the "Phases/Data" row</span><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
as shown on the picture, to make sure that all necessary Phase
definition records will be copied into the project database. </font><span
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Click on the "Ok"
button when ready. </span><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Next,
the setup dialog for
aqueous and gas phase models will appear (not shown). Click on the "Ok"
button -
this will select the Davies model for aqueous activity coefficients and
the
ideal gas mixture model for gases (defaults).</font><span
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> In a few seconds
(depends on the performance of your PC), you should see the "Modelling
Project" dialog:<br>
</span></p>
<span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><img
 src="sshgal-26-2.png" alt="Modelling Project dialog"
 style="width: 452px; height: 474px;"> </span>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
In the above dialog, click on the "Single-System Equilibria..." button
to create a first definition of the chemical system</font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> at 1 bar and 25 <sup>o</sup>C</font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> (SysEq record keyed &nbsp;"</font><big><tt>RaBaSrCa:G:TestSSAS:0:0:1:25:0:</tt></big>"
).<span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> The "Remake"
dialog will appear next; simply click on the "Ok" button to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> Now, the
"Compos" page of the "System" window should be visible. In that window,
you need to enter the "recipe" for the bulk chemical composition of the
system. Enter also something into the comment lines. The recipe to
enter is: <br>
1000 g water + 10 kg of air "<big><tt>AtmAirNit</tt></big>" + 0.1 mol
NaCl + 1 g BaCO<sub>3</sub> + 100 g CaCO<sub>3</sub> +10 g SrCO<sub>3</sub>
+ 0.01 g RaCO<sub>3</sub>. </span><span
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">After entering
the recipe</span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">,
the "Compos" page should look like this:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><img src="sshgal-26-4.png"
 alt="Compos page" style="height: 611px; width: 487px;"> <br>
</font></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">As seen on
the screen image, there is no entry in the PCO list for adding 0.01 g
RaCO3 to the system bulk composition. This is not a problem
because&nbsp; the stoicniometry (formula) of any Dependent Component
from the system definition can be used for addition to bulk composition
just in the same way as&nbsp; PCO amounts on the "Compos" page on the
above screen image. Thus, to complete our recipe, switch to the "DComp"
page of the "System" dialog , scroll the list of DC down until you find
the <b><big><tt>RaCO3@</tt></big></b> species, and put 0.01 g into the
respective cell of the&nbsp; <b><big><tt>xd_</tt></big></b> column (do
not forget to change "M" to "g" as a code of units of measurement in
the respective </span><big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">XDun_</span></big><span
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> cell).</span><br>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Now, switch to the "Single
Thermodynamic System" dialog and click on the "Calculate BCC" <img
 src="RunBCC.png" alt="Calc BCC" style="height: 20px; width: 20px;">
&nbsp;toolbar button; then examine the list of phases in the "Input:
System Definition" page. Below aqueous and gaseous phases, you should
see entries for two ternary and four binary solid solution phases; each
of them can
be expanded to see its end-members.</font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> Switch off the following entries:</font></p>
<blockquote><big><tt>(Ba,Ca)CO3(reg)<br>
(Ra,Ca)CO3(reg)<br>
(Sr,Ca)CO3(reg)<br>
Witherite<br>
Aragonite<br>
Calcite<br>

<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The resulting page should
look like that shown below:&nbsp;</font></p>

 style="height: 20px; width: 20px;"> )&nbsp; again and then
GEM-calculate (<img src="RunIPM.png" alt="Calculate GEM"
 style="height: 20px; width: 20px;"> ) the equilibrium state. After
clicking on the "Accept" button in the
"Progress Dialog", you should see the following phase speciation tree: <br>
</font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
In addition to aqueous electrolyte and gas mixture, we have three solid
solution phases present in this (hypothetical) partitioning
equilibrium:&nbsp; two non-ideal ternaries and one ideal binary. Even
though setting up and
calculating this system was technically simple, the behavior of
partitioning
equilibria is complex. To understand what has been calculated, we have
first
to look at how the phase definitions of solid solutions were arranged.
This
can be done by clicking on the "Explore results" &nbsp;<img
 src="ordertool.png" alt="Explore button"
 style="height: 22px; width: 22px;"> &nbsp;toolbar button and selecting
the "EqPh" page in the appearing EqDemo window. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><img src="sshgal-26-7.png"
 alt="EqDemo EqPh" style="width: 563px; height: 550px;"> <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Select a phase name with
the left-mouse drag (as shown above) and press the </font><b><big><tt>F7</tt></big></b><font

 alt="Ideal Phase" style="height: 235px; width: 594px;"> <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The definition of ideal
mixture just tells the program which end-members make it up (in this
case, witherite BaCO<sub>3</sub> and radium carbonate RaCO<sub>3</sub>,
with stoichiometries and thermodynamic properties defined in the
respective ReacDC database records).&nbsp; The (Ba,Ra)CO<sub>3</sub>
solid solution can be considered as a Raoultian ideal mixture because
the ionic radii of Ba<sup>+2</sup> and Ra<sup>+2</sup> are similar,
thus, no significant non-ideal effects are expected. This is not the
case, however, for the other two ternary solutions involving Sr<sup>+2</sup>
and Ca<sup>+2</sup> end-members. Close the "Phase" window, mark the "</font><big><tt>(Ca,Ba,Sr)CO3</tt></big>"
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">entry in the "EqPh" page, and

<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">As seen on Page 1 above,
the solid solution is assembled from three end-members, two of which
are assumed to be minor (marked as "</font><big><tt>J</tt></big><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">" ) and one (calcite) - a major
end-member (marked as "</font><big><tt>M</tt></big><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">"). This coding is necessary
because the positive values of interaction parameters for all three
binaries in this ternary model are large enough to produce miscibility
gaps (more about non-ideal solid solution models can be found in
the&nbsp; <a
 href="http://les.web.psi.ch/Software/GEMS-PSI/doc/pdf/Activity-Coeffs.pdf">Activity-Coeffs.pdf</a></font><font

itself is arranged, can be seen on Page 3 of this Phase window:&nbsp;<br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The code "T" in the first
row defines a regular Margules ternary mixing model; the code "S" tells
the program that a built-in function to calculate the activity
coefficients of end-members has to be used and it will take the
interaction parameters from a table below (expressed in J/mol units). <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Now, close the Phase
window, </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> mark the "</font><big><tt>(Ra,Ba,Sr)CO3</tt></big>"

</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">This &nbsp;solid solution
is arranged in the same way as previous, except that a miscibility gap
is not expected in the witherite-RaCO<sub>3</sub> binary because of a
small assumed value of the interaction parameter (a12 = 0.5), yet large
miscibility gaps are expected within two other binaries; and the
strontianite Str is denoted as a major ("M") end-member. Of course, all
these interaction parameters and
end-member coding can be changed, or new solid solutions can be added
in
the "Thermodynamic Database" mode of GEM-Selektor (as shown e.g. on <a
 href="http://les.web.psi.ch/Software/GEMS-PSI/screenshots/sshgal22.html">Page
22 of this screenshot tutorial</a>).<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><a name="INIT_PARTITIONING"></a>Now,
close the Phase window and get back to the "Single Thermodynamic
System" dialog
(expand gas and solid solution phases): <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><img src="sshgal-26-6.png"
 alt="Eqstat dialog again" style="width: 821px; height: 644px;"> <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">You can see that this
equilibrium contains five co-existing solution phases: non-ideal
aqueous electrolyte "aq_gen",
ideal gas mixture "gas_gen", "mainly calcite" non-ideal solid solution
"(Ca,Ba,Sr)CO3",
</font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">"mainly strontianite"
non-ideal
solid solution "(Ra,Ba,Sr)CO3"</font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">, and&nbsp;</font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">"mainly witherite" ideal solid
solution "(Ba,Ra)CO3(id)". Three potential single-conponent solid
phases do not appear in positive amounts as they are strongly
undersaturated. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">In this <i>partition
equilibrium state</i>, cations are distributed between the aqueous
electrolyte and three solid solution phases, and carbonate CO<sub>3</sub>
is distributed between all five phases. Take, for instance, radium - a
minor component in this hypothetical system. Out of total Ra amount
3.496e-5 mol (you can see it e.g. in the "b" column on "EqIC" page of
"EqDemo" window which you can open with <img src="ordertool.png"
 alt="EqDemo button" style="width: 22px; height: 22px;"> &nbsp; toolbar
button), 2.6508e-5 mol or 75.8% went into
the&nbsp;</font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">"(Ba,Ra)CO3(id)"</font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> phase, 1.07e-6 mol or 3.05% is
bound in the </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">"(Ra,Ba,Sr)CO3"</font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> phase, and the rest 21.15% or
7.38e-6 mol is dissolved in the aqueous phase. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Note that radium is mainly
partitioned into the </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">"(Ba,Ra)CO3(id)"</font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> phase because of two reasons.
Firstly, witherite is relatively less soluble among pure alkali-earth
carbonates. Secondly,
the stability of radium end-member in the </font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">"(Ra,Ba,Sr)CO3"</font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> phase is much influenced by a
high activity
coefficient of RaCO3 end-member ( 227.77 ), which makes it
less
preferential for radium to be incorporated into "mainly strontianite",
even
though there is ca. 10 times more strontium than barium in this system.
The
mole fraction ca. 0.01 of RaCO3 in the (Ba,Ra)CO3(id) solid solution
keeps
the activity&nbsp; of RaCO3 end member close to 0.01 (<i>a</i> = 0.009)
and, consequently, pure RaCO3 is ca. 100 times undersaturated, as seen
on
the screenshot above. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Another interesting thing
to see in this calculation is the activity of BaCO3 (witherite): in all
three phases it is the same (<i>a</i> =
0.99083), although concentrations (mole fractions) of "witherite"
end-members are different between
three phases. This is because of different values of activity
coefficients - rather high in both ternary phases that limit mole
fractions of witherite to minor values at the edges of miscibility
gaps. For instance, mole fraction of witherite in "mainly strontianite"
phase is only 0.7 %, and that in the "mainly calcite' phase is 0.15 % -
both are negligible. In the "mainly witherite" phase, the mole
fractions of strontianite and calcite must also be expected negligible
(below 1 %), and since this phase itself is present in small amount
(2.9 mmol), the stontianite and calcite end members in the "mainly
witherite" phase have been safely ignored. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Overall, this system has
been set up correctly in a sense that all four possble phases that may
appear together
due to highly non-ideal mixing effects have been included (the
Ra-carbonate phase was undersaturated because the total amount of Ra in
the system was low). <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Now, it is easy to explore
how the partitioning of Ra, Ba and Sr will change in responce to
changes in the bulk composition of the system. &nbsp;Execute the
"Record" "New(Clone)" menu command and change the fourth field of SysEq
record key from 0 to 1, to "clone" a new system&nbsp;</font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> "</font><big><tt>RaBaSrCa:G:TestSSAS:1:0:1:25:0:</tt></big>"
. <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">In the appearing "Compos"
page of the "System" window, change the amount of BaCO3 in the "recipe"
from 1 g to 10 g. Press </font><b><big><tt>Enter</tt></big></b><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">, close the "System" window and
calculate the equilibrium state (use the "Run GEM" &nbsp;<img
 src="RunIPM.png" alt="Run GEM" style="height: 22px; width: 22px;">
&nbsp;toolbar button and press "Accept" button when GEM IPM algorithm
has converged). &nbsp;Now, click on the</font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> "Explore results" &nbsp;<img

 style="width: 624px; height: 407px;"> <br>
</p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The calculated dissolved
Ra concentration
is now 5.7e-7 molal. To compare with our first example, simply switch
to
the "Single Thermodynamic System" dialog (do not close the "EqDemo"
window),
click there on the "Display previous record" &nbsp;<img
 src="arrow_left1.png" alt="Previous" style="height: 16px; width: 16px;">
&nbsp;toolbar button, and switch back to the "EqDemo" window. The
previous calculation resulted in 7.385e-6 molal of dissolved Ra, or
almost 13 times greater than in the second case (remember that we have
made the addition of
BaCO3 only 10 times more). By toggling between two calculations
with&nbsp;<img src="arrow_left1.png" alt="Previous"
 style="height: 16px; width: 16px;"> &nbsp;and&nbsp;<img
 src="arrow_right1.png" alt="Next record"
 style="height: 16px; width: 16px;"> &nbsp;toolbar buttons, you can see
that dissolved concentrations of Ba, Ca, and Sr have changed only
slightly. What caused such a non-linear and strong
effect on dissolved radium?&nbsp;<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">This is easy to see when
one switches to the "Results" page of </font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">"Single Thermodynamic System"
dialog and expands all solid solution phases, as shown below: <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><img src="sshgal-26-13.png"
 alt="Another SSAS" style="width: 821px; height: 567px;"> <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Comparison of this
partitioning with the <a href="#INIT_PARTITIONING">initial one</a>
shows that amount and composition of the "(Ca,Ba,Sr)CO3" phase almost
did not change (this is why total dissolved concentrations of Ca, Ba
and Sr almost did not change either). The amount and mole fraction of
"witherite" end-member in the "(Ra,Ba,Sr)CO3" phase increased in less
than 1% (remember, we added 10 times more BaCO3 to the recipe)! The
reason for that is that both non-ideal ternary solid solutions are
"saturated" with BaCO<sub>3</sub> and cannot accept more barium because
the amounts of their "major" end-members (calcite and strontianite) did
not change.&nbsp; <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">So, almost all the added
barium must have been precipitated into the "(Ba,Ra)CO3(id)" solid
solution phase. Indeed, the new amount of the latter phase is 0.0485 <i>/</i>
0.00287 = 17 times more than that in the initial calculation. A
consequence for that is that radium re-partitioned even stronger into
the "mainly witherite" phase (the amount of "witherite" end-member in
this phase is now 3.4307e-5 <i>/</i> 5.6508e-5 = 1.3 times more).
However, the mole fraction of "witherite" in "</font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">(Ba,Ra)CO3(id)</font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">" phase has decreased ca. 0.009167
<i>/</i> 0.000708 = 13 times, and this caused ca. 13 times decrease in
total dissolved Ra molality. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Let us see now what
happens if
there is not enough barium in the system to precipitate the "mainly
witherite" phase. To do this, "clone" a new SysEq record </font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">"</font><big><tt>RaBaSrCa:G:TestSSAS:2:0:1:25:0:</tt></big>"
. <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">In the appearing "Compos"
page of the "System" window, change the amount of BaCO3 in the "recipe"
to 0.1 g; press </font><b><big><tt>Enter</tt></big></b><font

calculate the equilibrium state (shown below).<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><img src="sshgal-26-14.png"
 alt="Case 3" style="width: 821px; height: 559px;"> <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Only two solid phases
are&nbsp; present, the "mainly witherite" phase is gone, as expected,
because its major end-member "witherite" is now undersaturated ( <i>a</i>
= 0.22 ). The remaining barium is re-distributed between "mainly
calcite", "mainly strontianite", and aqueous phases; radium is
distributed between &nbsp;"mainly strontianite" and aqueous phases.
Total dissolved concentration of barium has decreased ca. 3.6 times to
0.00012 molal, and total dissolved radium has increased to
3.16e-5 molal, which is still 1.5 orders of magnitude below that at
equilibrium with pure RaCO<sub>3</sub>. The system composition went
away from one of the
possible miscibility gaps, and the number of co-existing phases has
decreased by one.&nbsp; </font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">From GEM results such as
considered above, one can easily calculate various distribution ratios
and partitioning coefficients to compare with experimental partitioning
data. One can also set up various Process simulators to plot
partitioning diagrams, modeled isotherms
and even Lippmann diagrams. Such process simulators are constructed
basically&nbsp;
in the same way as described on <a href="sshgal11.html">Page 11 in
this screenshot
tutorial</a>.&nbsp; In this example, </font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">there are three non-ideal binary
solid solutions</font></p>

  <br>
  <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">(Ra,Ca)CO3(reg)</font> <br>
  <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">(Sr,Ca)CO3(reg)</font></blockquote>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">that were switched off in
the calculated example. &nbsp;You can create a new SysEq record with
one of these phases switched on (and other solid solutions switched
off) and use it as a "parent" system to create Process simulators that
plot, e.g., partition isotherms,
i.e. plot total dissolved concentration of one metal as function of
it's
end-member mole fraction in solid solution.&nbsp;</font></p>
