    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(23) How
        to create
        your first Process Simulator. </span><br>
    </p>
    <p>In Gem-Selektor Main Window, in Equilibria Mode, click at the "Process"
      icon on the left side (or use "Modules" "Process" menu command) to open
      the (still empty) Process
      window. There, click on the "Create a new record from scratch" (or execute
      the "Record" "Create(New)" menu command). This will
      bring you into a "Parent System selection" dialog (shown below). <br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="sshgal-11-1.png" alt="Parent Selection" style="width: 668px; height: 255px;">
      <br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>In the above
      dialog, select (as shown) the "parent" chemical system (SysEq record) that
      you have
      prepared before, and click "Ok" to
      proceed.&nbsp; The following small dialog appears now (with asterisks
      in the two last fields): <br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="sshgal-11-2.png" alt="Proces Key" style="width: 456px; height: 389px;">
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>The first
      eight fields of the Process record key (not editable) are identical with
      that of the
      "parent" SysEq
      record key. Indeed, the program uses that to immediate record to load the
      "parent" system each time when the Process record is loaded from the
      database. <br>
    </p>
    <p>You have to
      fill
      out the last two fields: "O2-titration" identifies the process
      simulator
      to be created, and "S" indicates that this will be a simple (straightforward)
change
      of the bulk composition, as shown above. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Click "Ok"
      when finished. This will get you to a Process Setup Wizard:&nbsp;<br>
    </p>
    <p><img title="Process Setup Wizard" src="sshgal-11-3.png" alt="Process Wizard 1"
        style="width: 668px; height: 570px;"> <br>
    </p>
    <p>The wizard
      consists of several pages that can be accessed by clicking on the "Next
      &gt;" or "&lt; Back" button. Each page contains some explanations
      important for setting up the process simulator properly (the explanations
      may be
      changed from version to version). <br>
    </p>
    <p> There is
      nothing to change on the first wizard page, so click "Next &gt;" switch
      to the second one - Step 2. </p>
    <p>The first iterator <span style="font-weight: bold;">iTm</span> defines
      how the program will number the generated system definitions (CSD). If we
      start with CSD #1000 and will produce 101
      points then we will end up with CSD #2000 at increment 10. Please, edit
      the iterator accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      Pressure (1 bar) and temperature (25 C) will be kept constant, so there
      is nothing to change in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">iP</span>
      and <span style="font-weight: bold;">iTC</span> iterators. The<span style="font-weight: bold;">
        iNv</span> iterator should usually be set the same as the last
      field of the "parent" SysEq record key, i.e. 0, 0, 0. <br>
      <br>
      The iNu iterator should contain the range ( 0 to 1 g) and the
      linear increment (0.01 g) for additions of the titrant O2 to bulk
      composition of the
      parent system.&nbsp; Check that the process type is set as "Titration cNu
      (linear)", as shown below. </p>
    <p>Click on the "Compos" property and select "O2" as a titrant. The
      automatically created Process control script will be visible at the
      right-hand side:</p>
    <img alt="Wizard Page 2" src="sshgal-11-4.png">
    <p>Click "Next &gt;" to proceed to Step 3 of the Process Wizard, which is
      very helpful to create the Process sampling script aimed at collecting and
      plotting the simulation results. </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <img alt="Wizard Page 3" src="sshgal-11-5.png">
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>"Important Dimensions"&nbsp; and change the first
      field (nPV Number of steps to be generated) to 51 and the third field
      (Number of plots...) to 5, as shown below: <br>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;<img src="sshgal-11-6.png" alt="Process Wizard 4" style="width: 800px; height: 553px;">
    </p>
    <p>The idea is to collect
      calculated values of CaAQ, FeAQ, MnAQ,
      -pH and pe at each of 51 simulation points and plot them.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>Click "Next &gt;"&nbsp; to
      proceed to the third wizard page, which&nbsp; contains some additional
      settings (for advanced users). Check that the selections look like
      shown below:<br>
    </p>
    <p><img alt="Third page of Process wizard" src="sshgal-11-7.png" style="width: 754px; height: 499px;"><br>
    </p>
    <p>Press "Next &gt;" now to
      see the last wizard page which contains explanations about how the
      process simulator works. On that page (not shown here), set&nbsp; the
      number of links to bibliography SDref records to 1; read the
      explanations, and click "Finish" when ready. &nbsp;A
      Page 1 of the "Process" window will appear; as usual, fill out the
      first
      two comment fields e.g. as shown below.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img src="sshgal-11-8.png" alt="Process Page 1" style="width: 800px; height: 550px;">
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>You can also type in the
      third row a reference to your comments or bibliography link ("Example2:2005:comm:"
      as shown above). <br>
    </p>
    <p>If you click on that field
      later
      and press F2, you will see a SDref window where
      you
      can type your comments (on Page 2) and save the SDref record to
      database. When you press (in the Process window page) F2
      on the pSDref
      field next time, your
      comments
      will pop up as they have been saved last time; you can change or extend
      them and save again,
      and so on. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Next, we will finalize and
      run the Process Simulator. <br>
