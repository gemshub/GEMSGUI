    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(23) How to create your first Process
        Simulator. </span><br>
    </p>
    <p>In Gem-Selektor Main Window, in Equilibria Mode, click at the "Process"
      icon on the left side (or use "Modules" "Process" menu command) to open
      the (still empty) Process window. There, click on the "Create a new record
      from scratch" (or execute the "Record" "Create(New)" menu command). This
      will bring you into a "Parent System selection" dialog (shown below). <br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="sshgal-11-1.png" alt="Parent Selection" style="width: 668px; height: 255px;">
      <br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>In the above dialog, select (as shown) the "parent" chemical system
      (SysEq record) that you have prepared previously, and click "Ok" to
      proceed.&nbsp; Now, a small Process record key dialog appears (with
      asterisks in the two last fields). </p>
    <p>The first eight fields of the Process record key are not editable; they
      are identical with that of the "parent" SysEq record key. Indeed, the
      program uses that record to to immediately load the "parent" system
      definition each time when the Process record is loaded from the database.
      <br>
    </p>
    You have to fill out the last two fields. Type "O2-titration" in the "Name
    ..." field to identify the process simulator to be created, and "S" in the
    "Process simulation mode..." field to indicate that this will be a simple
    (straightforward)
    change of the bulk composition, as shown below.
    <p> </p>
    <p><img src="sshgal-11-2.png" alt="Proces Key" style="width: 456px; height: 389px;">
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>Click "Ok" when finished. This will get you to a Process Setup
      Wizard:&nbsp;<br>
    </p>
    <p><img title="Process Setup Wizard" src="sshgal-11-3.png" alt="Process Wizard 1"
        style="width: 668px; height: 570px;"> <br>
    </p>
    <p>The wizard consists of several steps (pages) that can be accessed by
      clicking on the "Next &gt;" or "&lt; Back" button. Each page contains some
      explanations important for setting up the process simulator properly (the
      explanations may be changed from version to version). <br>
    </p>
    <p> There is nothing to change on the first wizard page, so click "Next
      &gt;" button to proceed to Step 2. You will see a small table, each column
      being an iterator consisting of three values: start (index [0]), end
      (index [1]), and increment (index [2]). At every step of the process, the
      current value of the respective property, beginning from start value, will
      be automatically incremented by the increment value. The process simulation
      stops when the end value of some iterator is reached, or the total number
      of steps is executed. The increment value of 0 deactivates the respective
      iterator. All iterators are also accessible in the Process module window
      (will appear after the Process Wizard is finished).</p>
    <p>The first iterator <span style="font-weight: bold;">iTm</span> defines
      how the program will number the chemical system definitions (CSD)
      generated by the process simulator. If start with CSD # equal to 1000 and
      produce 101 points then the end value will be 2000 and the increment will
      be 10. Please, edit the iTm iterator accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      Pressure (1 bar) and temperature (25 C) will be kept constant, so there is
      nothing to change in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">iP</span> and <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">iTC</span> iterators. The<span style="font-weight: bold;">
        iNv</span> iterator should usually be set the same as the last field of
      the "parent" SysEq record key, i.e. 0, 0, 0. <br>
      <br>
      The iNu iterator should contain the range ( 0 to 1 g) and the linear
      increment (0.01 g) for additions of the titrant O2 to bulk composition of
      the parent system.&nbsp; Check that the process type is set as "Titration
      cNu (linear)", as shown below. </p>
    <p>Click on the "Compos" property and select "O2" as a titrant. This
      automatically creates a simple Process control script, visible at the
      right-hand side (this script can be modified later in the Process module
      window, if necessary):</p>
    <img alt="Wizard Page 2" src="sshgal-11-4.png">
    <p>Click "Next &gt;" to proceed to Step 3 of the Process Wizard, which is
      helpful for creating the Process sampling script, aimed at collecting and
      plotting the simulation results. In this exercise, aimed at following how
      the aqueous speciation changes upon oxidation of the system, we would plot
      the total dissolved molalities of Ca, Fe, Mn, as well as pH, pe and Eh of
      aqueous solution, as curves against the "process extent variable", in this
      case the stepwise addition of O2. </p>
    <p>The Step 3 wizard page is arranged similar to the Recipe Wizard. At the
      left-hand side, you see a list of Properties. Click on the "lgm_t"
      property (log10 of total dissolved molality of elements) and in the "Item
      Selection" list, click to select Ca, Fe and Mn. Next, in "Property" list,
      click on "Scalars" and, in the "Item Selection" list, click on pH, pe, Eh
      to select them. Then, in the same list, find "modC", right-click on it and
      select "Abscissa". After doing all this, you should see a "Sampling
      script", as shown in the screen image below.</p>
    <img alt="Wizard Page 3" src="sshgal-11-5.png">
    <p>This sampling script will appear later also in the Process module window
      Now, click<br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>"Important Dimensions"&nbsp; and change the first field (nPV Number of
      steps to be generated) to 51 and the third field (Number of plots...) to
      5, as shown below: <br>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;<img src="sshgal-11-6.png" alt="Process Wizard 4" style="width: 800px; height: 553px;">
    </p>
    <p>The idea is to collect calculated values of CaAQ, FeAQ, MnAQ, -pH and pe
      at each of 51 simulation points and plot them.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>Click "Next &gt;"&nbsp; to proceed to the third wizard page, which&nbsp;
      contains some additional settings (for advanced users). Check that the
      selections look like shown below:<br>
    </p>
    <p><img alt="Third page of Process wizard" src="sshgal-11-7.png" style="width: 754px; height: 499px;"><br>
    </p>
    <p>Press "Next &gt;" now to see the last wizard page which contains
      explanations about how the process simulator works. On that page (not
      shown here), set&nbsp; the number of links to bibliography SDref records
      to 1; read the explanations, and click "Finish" when ready. &nbsp;A Page 1
      of the "Process" window will appear; as usual, fill out the first two
      comment fields e.g. as shown below.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img src="sshgal-11-8.png" alt="Process Page 1" style="width: 800px; height: 550px;">
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>You can also type in the third row a reference to your comments or
      bibliography link ("Example2:2005:comm:" as shown above). <br>
    </p>
    <p>If you click on that field later and press F2, you will see a SDref
      window where you can type your comments (on Page 2) and save the SDref
      record to database. When you press (in the Process window page) F2 on the
      pSDref field next time, your comments will pop up as they have been saved
      last time; you can change or extend them and save again, and so on. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Next, we will finalize and run the Process Simulator. <br>
