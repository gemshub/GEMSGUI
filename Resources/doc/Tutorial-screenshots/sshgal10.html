    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(21)</span> Let us now try how&nbsp; the
      GEMS code
      performs "batch" model runs, or process simulations, where many
      equilibrium states are generated from a regular change in T,P, bulk
      composition, or other input
      data. <br>
      <br>
      First of all, a process simulation requires one "parent" chemical
      system definition with calculated equilibrium state to be present in
      the project database. Here, we will create a "parent" system by cloning
      the previously calculated SysEq record for the closed carbonate system.
      &nbsp;<br>
    </p>
    <p>In the "Single
      Thermodynamic System" dialog, click the "Clone" toolbar button&nbsp; <img
        alt="Clone button" src="NewCloneRecordIcon24.png">&nbsp; or select a
      Record -&gt; New("Clone") menu
      command, and change the old record key "Carbonate:G:CaFeMnHypC:0:0:1:25:0:"
      to a new one: "Carbonate:G:CaFeMnHypC:1:0:1:25:0:".
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>In the Recipe Dialog, change the
      comment, and add 0.01 mol CH4 (methane), as shown
      below. <br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;<img src="sshgal-10-1.png" alt="Compos Parent" style="width: 764px; height: 511px;">
    </p>
    <p>Now, click "Ok" to switch to the
      "Single Thermodynamic System" dialog, and click on the "Calculate GEM
      IPM" &nbsp; <img src="CalculateGEMIcon24.png" alt="Run IPM button" height="20"
        width="20"> &nbsp;&nbsp; toolbar button. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Accept
      the calculation results after the GEM IPM has converged. You should
      see now something like that&nbsp; below (expand
      some phases):<br>
    </p>
    <p><br>

      The presence of a stable
      Graphite phase (0.016 mol) indicates that this system is completely
      reduced. This is also evident from mainly methane-nitrogen composition
      of the gas phase at rather high pH = 9.15, low fugacity of carbon
      dioxide <span style="font-style: italic;">f</span> CO<sub>2</sub>,
      and&nbsp; extremely low&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">f</span>
      O<sub>2</sub> = 1.4e-74. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Siderite is now
      undersaturated, and iron is present mainly in Magnetite, at rather low
      total dissolved Fe<sub>AQ</sub> = 1.3e-7 molal. You can see this on the
      EqIC page of EqDemo window accessible by clicking the "Open EqDemo window"
      <img src="ShowGEMResultsIcon24.png" alt="Show Eqstat button" height="24" width="24">
      &nbsp; toolbar button, as shown below. <br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="sshgal-10-3.png" alt="EqDemo parent" style="width: 783px; height: 390px;">
      <br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">(22)</span> This system seems to
      be a nice start point for a stepwise addition of an oxidant (e.g. O<sub>2</sub>)
      to the closed system. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The objective of&nbsp;performing such a titration with oxygen
      is usually to see how
      changing redox conditions may influence the equilibrium phase
      assemblage, or solubilities of Ca, Fe, Mn, pH and Eh in the aqueous
      solution. </p>
    <p>Before proceeding with
      the setup of the Process Simulator to perform the O<sub>2</sub> titration,
      we must find out how much added O<sub>2</sub> would be sufficient to
      completely oxidize this system. Such an assessment can be done easily
      by the "trial and error" method. &nbsp;<br>
    </p>
    <p>Just open again the Compos
      page of System window, add 0.7 g O<sub>2</sub> to the recipe there, and
      re-calculate the equilibrium. You should see that Graphite and
      Magnetite phases disappear, but Rhodochrosite is still there; this
      means that the system is not yet
      completely oxidized. Change the O<sub>2</sub> addition to 1 g and
      calculate
      the equilibrium again; now, pyrolusite appears instead of
      rhodochrosite,
      and the system is completely oxidized. <br>
    </p>
    <p>So, it is sufficient to
      add O<sub>2</sub>
      to the bulk composition in 0.01 g steps up to 1 g, which will give us 101
      simulation points. <br>
    </p>
    <p>One more consideration is
      that Manganite or Hausmannite phases are more likely to precipitate
      than Pyrolusite in natural waters; this means that we have to disable
      the Pyrolusite phase. To do this, in the
      "Single Thermodynamic System" dialog, click on the "Input:System
      Definition" tab; expand the "Pyrolusite" phase; and, in the "Upper_KC"
      cell for Pyrolusite, enter 0 instead of the default value 1e+006.&nbsp;
      After that, r0ecalculate
      the
      equilibrium and check that &nbsp;Manganite appears instead of
      Pyrolusite.
      <br>
    </p>
    <p> Now, our parent system is
      ready - do not forget to remove the "trial" O<sub>2</sub> addition,
      recalculate, and save the SysEq record. <br>
