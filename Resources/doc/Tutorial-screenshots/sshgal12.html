    <p>(24) How
      to
      set up iterators and scripts in your first Process Simulator. <br>
    </p>
    What remains is
    to set the Process iterators, provide the simulation- and the
    data-sampling math scripts, run the simulation, and plot the results. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    After you have set the iterators, Page 1 of the Process window should
    look like this: <br>
    <br>
    <img src="sshgal-12-1.png" alt="Process Iterators" style="width: 621px; height: 478px;">
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    A&nbsp;large (still empty) field at the bottom should contain a math
    script that tells the program what and how to change during the process
    simulation. To facilitate writing of such scripts, the GEMS code is
    provided with the "Template script library", accessible via the "Help"
    "Scripts..." menu command or the F3 keystroke.
    Press F3 to see
    the following dialog: <br>
    <br>
    <img src="sshgal-12-2.png" alt="Template scripts" height="327" width="540">
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Select a suitable template script for incremental titrations, as shown
    above, and press "Ok". &nbsp;This will open a SDref window: <br>
    <br>
    <img src="sshgal-12-3.png" alt="SDref page 1" height="497" width="641">
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The template script itself is visible on Page 2 of the SDref window: <br>
    <br>
    <img src="sshgal-12-4.png" alt="SDref page 2" height="503" width="606">
    <br>
    <br>
    Read the comments, then mark the script (with left mouse key pressed)
    as shown above, and press &nbsp;Ctrl-C &nbsp;to
    take it
    into clipboard. <br>
    <br>
    Switch to Page 1 of the Process window, click on the big P_expr
    field and press Ctrl-V&nbsp; to paste the text
    there. <br>
    <br>
    Now you have to edit two lines: put O2 instead of CaO
    (because we want to add oxygen and not lime), and uncomment (remove the
    $ character) the next line to collect additions of
    oxygen into the modC vector. <br>
    <br>
    The final appearance of Page 1 should be like this: <br>
    <br>
    <img src="sshgal-12-5.png" alt="Process Script 1" height="463" width="761">
    <br>
    <br>
    Please, note that the first and the last operators are not really
    needed (commented out) - the program will perform the same operations
    automatically.
    These operators are present for showing what the script actually does.
    &nbsp;An
    internal index&nbsp; J &nbsp;indicates the current
    process
    simulation point and will also be incremented automatically. The&nbsp; modC
    &nbsp;array is visible to the right of the script - there we will
    collect
    the O2 increment (in grams) for each point for the
    subsequent
    plotting.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Now, switch to Page 2 where we have to provide another script for data
    sampling and plotting (in the large pgExpr text
    field
    at the bottom). <br>
    <br>
    Just as &nbsp;for the first time, press F3 and
    select
    a&nbsp; "mscript-plot-aqueous:0001:proces:" record
    from
    the list. <br>
    <br>
    On page 2 of the appearing SDref record, mark and copy (Ctrl-C)
    the first five lines, then switch back to the Process window and paste
    (Ctrl-V)
    the text into the pgExpr field. Edit the script as
    shown below: <br>
    <br>
    <img src="sshgal-12-6.png" alt="Sampling script" style="width: 726px; height: 499px;">
    <br>
    <br>
    The xp and yp arrays are
    accessible on the "Graph" page of the Process window.&nbsp; The lgm_t,
    pH and pe data objects can be seen on
    pages of the EqDemo window that can be opened by clicking the "Detailed
    results" <img src="ordertool.png" alt="Show Eqstat button" height="24" width="24">
    &nbsp; toolbar button on the
    "Single
    Termodynamic System" dialog. &nbsp;Writing "0 - pH"
    instead
    of "-pH" is required by the syntax of GEMS math
    scripts.
    &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    We are now ready to run the Process simulator.
