    <p>(7) A window appearing below means
      that
      your project has been opened or created and now you are ready to model
      geochemical
      equilibria. In
      the upper right corner you see a key of SysEq record about to becreated in
      the project database; this record key uniquely identifies your system
      (identical
      record keys are not allowed in GEM-Selektor databases). &nbsp;<br>
    </p>
    In the
    middle, you see a list of thermodynamic phases comprising the system
    (under the "Input: System Definition" tab). By expanding any of the items
    in this list, you will get a list of chemical species included into this
    phase. By reading tooltips on the toolbar buttons, you can learn abou tmain
    actions that can be performed from this dialog.
    <p>
    </p>
    <p><img title="GEMS Equilibrium Modelling Dialog" src="sshgal-4-1.png" alt="EqmodDialog"
        style="width: 800px; height: 546px;"> <br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>If the project is empty (newly-created) then,&nbsp; over this window, you
      will see a modal dialog, in which GEM-Selektor asks you to give a name to
      the
      newly-created
      system, as well as its temperature
      and pressure of interest. <br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="sshgal-4-2.png" alt="SysEqKeyDialog" style="width: 447px; height: 337px;">
      <br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>By reading comments or the help page, you
      can learn the meaning of each of eight fields of this SysEq record key,
      under
      which your new system and equilibrium state will be stored in the
      "Carbonate"
      project database. Let us call the new system "CaFeMnOpen"
      and assume that it exists at
      ambient conditions (1 bar pressure, 25 <sup>o</sup>C temperature).
      Type the name
      (as shown on the dialog), leave "0" in the field below the name, and press
      "Ok" to proceed. </p>
    <p>(8) Immediately, an "Input Recipe Dialog" pops up: <br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="sshgal-4-3.png" alt="Empty Recipe Dialog" style="width: 764px; height: 511px;">
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>This dialog provides several means of putting together the bulk
      composition of chemical system, opening windows with input and output data
      for chemical equilibrium speciation in this system, as well as some other
      settings and tweaks.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>If you close the Recipe dialog, you can always open it again by clicking
      on the "Open Recipe Dialog..." toolbar button on the&nbsp; <a name="SYSTEM_DIALOG"></a>Single
Thermodynamic
System
      Dialog toolbar (shows tooltips). This is the eighth button (orange bottle)
      in the toolbar, see below. <br>
    </p>
    <p><img title="Single System Toolbar" src="sshgal-4-4.png" alt="Single System"
        style="width: 506px; height: 39px;"> <br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>In
      principle, the only thing you have to do in order to complete the
      chemical system definition is to specify a "recipe" for the total bulk
      composition of the system. The easiest way to do it is to open the Recipe
      Dialog (if you closed it), and proceed to the next page.
