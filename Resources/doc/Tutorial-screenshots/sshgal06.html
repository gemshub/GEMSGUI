      After the equilibrium state has been calculated and saved in the
      database, you will see a "Results" page (tab) of the "Single
      Thermodynamic System" dialog (if you see another window, click at the
      "SysEq" icon on the left-hand side):<br>
      <br>

    <p><img title="Equilibrium Calculation Results Dialog" src="sshgal-6-1.png"
        alt="Equilibrium results tab" style="width: 800px; height: 530px;"> <br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
      This page shows a list of all potentially present phases (aq_gen
      denotes aqueous electrolyte, gas_gen - gas mixture); number of
      species (components) included in each phase; and the mole amount of each
      phase
      at equilibrium. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Stable phases appear in
      positive mole quantities, with stability indexes (logSI) close to zero;
      unstable phases - in zero quantities, with significantly negative logSI
      values. Note
      that, even though there were three initial metal carbonate ingredients
      (CaCO<sub>3</sub>,
      FeCO<sub>3</sub> and MnCO<sub>3</sub>), only one (Calcite) appears as a
      stable solid phase at equilibrium. Iron appears as Goethite phase
      (FeOOH), and manganese - as Pyrolusite (MnO<sub>2</sub>) instead of the
      respective carbonates Siderite FeCO<sub>3</sub> and Rhodochrosite MnCO<sub>3</sub>
      whose compositions were initially given as recipe ingredients. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The reason, of course, is
      the oxidizing gas atmosphere - the gas phase containing 20% O<sub>2</sub>
      is present in a large excess (almost 10400 moles). This results in pe =
      12.29, visible in the Status line in the lower part of the dialog. Both
      iron and manganese carbonate
      phases would be stable only in the absence of gaseous oxygen, at reducing
      conditions.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(14)</span> Each phase entry can be
      expanded to see dependent components (species) in this phase (below).
      To expand/shrink the phase, mouse-click on the "+"/"-" sign on the
      list view tree.&nbsp; </p>

      Now, in the "Amount (mol)" column, you can see mole amounts <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">x</span>
      of
      species
      (components) present at equilibrium in each phase. The amount of a phase
      is actually the sum of amounts of all its components. To the right, the
      activity values (calculated using the GEM dual
      solution vector <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">u</span>)
      for phase components are shown. For
      gases, these numbers are actually fugacities, and for single-component
      solids they mean the plain saturation index (1 - saturated, &lt; 1 -
      under-saturated, &gt; 1 - super-saturated). The last column shows the
      calculated activity coefficients (1 in any phase with simple ideal
      mixing).<br>
    </p>
    <p>On
      the above screenshot, you can see that the system is saturated with
      respect to calcite, and 19.3 orders of magnitude under-saturated to Siderite
      (Sd). The system is also slightly under-saturated to aragonite. <br>
    </p>
    <p>In
      the "Concentration" column, the mole fractions of gases in the gas
      phase are pretty much the same as those usually present in the
      atmosphere. <br>
    </p>
    <p>By
      expanding the "aq_gen" phase, you can also examine the equilibrium
      aqueous speciation (not shown); note that activity and concentration
      for aqueous species are expressed in practical (molal, mol/kgH<sub>2</sub>O)
      scale.<br>

      window..." toolbar button or "View" "GEM IPM task results..." menu item (proceed
