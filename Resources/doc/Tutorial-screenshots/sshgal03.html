    <p>(6) After giving a name to a new project,
      you
      will see a "Selection of databases..." dialog. To proceed, make selections
      as shown in the screen image below, and click "Next &gt;".</p>
    <img alt="Selection of databases dialog" src="sshgal-3-0.png">
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>This will select the complete PSI-Nagra chemical thermodynamic database
      as a basis for your modeling project, and give this project access to
      SDref records with literature references and template scripts. </p>
    <p>After the "Next &gt;" button was clicked, a "Select Independent
      Components" Dialog appears: <br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="sshgal-3-1.png" alt="ElementsDialog" style="height: 560px; width: 737px;">
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>By clicking toggle buttons
      with
      element symbols, you can conveniently set up the <span style="font-style: italic;">stoichiometry
        basis</span> of
      your modeling project and all
      chemical systems to be created within it.&nbsp;
      Selected
      elements, charge, or ligands (Independent Components) &nbsp;are shown as
      pressed and
      highlighted
      buttons. <br>
    </p>
    <p>After you have made a
      selection (as shown on the screenshot above) and clicked "Next &gt;", the
      GEM-Selektor program
      will search default chemical thermodynamic databases (selected previously
      in "Selection of databases..." dialog) for
      all suitable species
      (Dependent Components), phases, and pre-defined
      compositions,
      and copy all database records found into your new project's database.
      During this process, some Phase and Compos records may be discarded; if
      needed, the list of those can be found in the "DiscardedRecords.txt"
      debugging file located in the same folder where the GEM-Selektor binary
      executalbe file exists. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Now, GEM-Selektor will ask you to
      select a built-in model for aqueous activity coefficients:<br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="sshgal-3-2.png" alt="" style="height: 494px; width: 737px;">&nbsp;
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>Several
      commonly-used activity models were collected into the TSolMod code library
      and built into GEM-Selektor. Some of them are listed in the above
      radio-button
      list; upon selection, some common parameters (shown on the right side)
      can
      be adjusted. Clicking the "Check" button will update contents of the
      dialog,
      for instance, the record key of the automatically created definition
      for
      the aqueous phase. <br>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Details about
      built-in calculations
      of acitivity coefficients in the latest GEM-Selektor version can be found
      in
      the&nbsp;
      <a href="../pdf/Activity-Coeffs.pdf">Activity-coeffs.pdf</a>
      &nbsp;manual in Gems3-App/Resources folder or on GEMS web site. Other,
      built-in aqueous activity models (e.g. Pitzer, SIT) or scripted models of
      mixing must be
      provided
      in advance in Phase definition records in the project database.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The second tab of this dialog can be used for selecting the gas/fluid
      mixture
      model
      (not needed in our present example, where the default ideal gas mixture
      will
      be used by default). <br>
    </p>
    <p>For
      now, just click the "Ok" button; the aqueous phase definition "aq_gen"
      using
      the Davies equation will be created automatically (all parameters on
      the
      right side will be ignored in this case). This operation may take some
      time; if so, you may see a small progress dialog like that shown below;
      just wait until it's finished.<br>
