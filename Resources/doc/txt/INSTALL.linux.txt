To install GEMS3.1 on linux (ubuntu >= 10.4; fedora >= 15; kubuntu >= 10.4; OpenSuSE >=12.0):

1. Copy the installer file into your home directory ~/ ("/home/<your-user-name>/").

2. Unpack the installer to your home directory. This will create a folder "~/Gems3-app/" that contains program and resource files, including help database and "/DB.default/" folder with thermodynamic database.

3. Optionally, you can now create in your home directory a folder like "~/MYGEMS/" and move the folder "~/Gems3-app/" in there.

4. In terminal, cd into "/Gems3-app/" wherever it is installed, and execute a command:  ./gems3.bash -d    (or ./gems3.sh -d). The GEMS3 program should launch; after you exit it, a folder ".../Library/Gems3/projects/" with several test modeling projects will be available at the same level as the ".../Gems3-app/" folder.

5. You can add existing third-party projects, or your old project folders into ".../Library/gems3/projects/".  Backup of modeling projects is strongly recommended at list once a day.

6. To create a desktop shortcut for starting GEMS3: copy the file GEMSv3.<x>.desktop from ".../Gems3-App/ToDesktop/" to the "~/Desktop/" folder; right-click on the GEMSv3 icon on your desktop and check the actual location of the program in the command line (e.g. /home/<your-user-name>/Gems3-app/gems3.bash -c) and location of the GEMS3 icon (e.g. /home/<your-user-name>/Gems3-app/gems3.png), and save.

7. Start GEMS3 by clicking on the desktop icon. If it does not start, check the path in the icon again, or try gems3.sh instead of gems3.bash (depends on the linux installation).

8. To update GEMS3, unpack the installer archive and replace with it the existing ".../Gems3-app/" folder only (your projects will remain intact in the ".../Library/Gems3/projects" folder).

9. To remove GEMS3 from your PC, simply delete both ".../Gems3-app/" and ".../Library/Gems3/" folders in your home directory.

All operations described above do not require root privileges.
