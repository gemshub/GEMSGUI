To install GEMS3.1 on Windows XP, Windows 7, or Windows 8:

To install GEM-Selektor on Windows XP, Windows 7, or Windows 8:

1. Copy the installer file into a temporary location and execute it.
 
2. The installer will ask where to install/update, showing "C:\Selektor" as a suggestion. If you accept this, the program will be located in "C:\Selektor\Gems3-app\". This folder contains program and resource files, including help database and the "\DB.default\" folder with the thermodynamic database. Upon the first start, a folder "C:\Selektor\Library\Gems3\projects\" will be created, where your modeling projects will be stored. The folder will initially contain some test projects.

3. Alternatively, you can type or select another location ("\Program Files" is not recommended), for example "D:\MyWork\Modeling". In this case, the program will be located in "D:\MyWork\Modeling\Gems3-app\" and the modeling projects- in "D:\MyWork\Modeling\Library\Gems3\projects\".

4. After extracting files, GEM-Selektor will start automatically; you can exit it and look for a GEMS v3 icon on your desktop, to be used further on for staring GEM-Selektor.  At a first-time installation, the "....\Library\Gems3\projects\" folder will be created and test projects copied in there from the "....\Gems3-app\Resources\projects\" folder. If the installer is executed for update/upgrade, the test projects will not be copied even they were updated in the "Resources" location. To refresh or reset a test project, please use any suitable file manager to copy the project subfolder over.

5. You can also use any file manager to add your existing old projects folders into the "....\Library\gems3\projects\". Backup of modeling projects from this folder is strongly recommended at least once per day.

6. To update the GEM-Selektor, start the installer and browse to the location where GEMS3 is installed, for example, to "D:\MyWork\Modeling\". Only files in the "\Gems3-app\" subfolder will be replaced; your existing modeling and test projects in "....\Library\gems3\projects\" will not be changed.
   
7. To remove the GEM-Selektor from your computer:  use a file manager to locate the installation folder (e.g. "D:\MyWork\Modeling\")  and delete it. Find the "GEMS3" icon on your desktop and drag it into the Recycle Bin. The GEMS3 installer does not change any Windows Registry entries.

Enjoy GEMS3!
