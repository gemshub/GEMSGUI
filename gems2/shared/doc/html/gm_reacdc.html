<h2><a name="REACDC_FORMAT"></a>1. Reaction-Defined Format of
Thermodynamic
Data for Dependent Components<br>
</h2>
<p>ReacDC records can be used for defining thermodynamic properties of
aqueous
or surface complexes and minerals, for which thermochemical data are
not
available or predicted data are too uncertain. For such species, only
log<i>K</i>
of the dissolution, association or surface complexation reaction is
usually
known at 25 <sup>o</sup>C or other temperatures. <br>
</p>
<p>A&nbsp;ReacDC record describes a reaction between <a
 href="glossary.html#DT_dependent_component">dependent components</a>
(species)
with stoichiometry coefficients and standard molar properties (dGr,
dHr,
dSr, dCpr, dVr), which set up a certain <i>T,P</i> &nbsp;dependence of
log<i>K</i>.
Because the GEM IPM algorithm cannot use reactions and their
equilibrium
constants to calculate the equilibrium speciation in phases, each
ReacDC
record also provides a set of standard molar (partial molal)
thermodynamic
properties for a "new" species. These standard properties of the "new"
species
are computed from standard molar properties of the reaction and those
of all
other species involved in the reaction. The "new", reaction-defined
species,
actually, gives a name to the reaction in the form of <a
 href="gdb_rkey.html#dbm_ReacDC">ReacDC record key</a>. Thermodynamic
properties
of the new species will be automatically maintained consistent to those
of
other species involved in the reaction at all feasible<i> T,P</i>
values.
There are several <a href="theortdb.html">methods of calculation</a>
of thermodynamic properties of reaction-defined species at elevated <i>T,P</i>.<br>
</p>
<p>When a ReacDC record for a "new" species is created, the "involved"
species
must already exist in the project database as either <a
 href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a> or ReacDC records. Any reaction defined
in
a ReacDC record can refer to other ReacDC records, thus forming a
"reaction
chain"; up to seven levels of such recursion are supported, i.e. the
ReacDC
record for an "involved" species can refer to another "involved"
ReacDC,
and so on, up to 7 levels. Any reaction chain always terminates with a
reaction
that refers to DComp records only. <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp; The ReacDC module and data format is a unique feature of
GEM-Selektor,
to our knowledge not yet available in other codes for equilibria
calculations
or for maintaining thermodynamic databases. Accordingly, GEM-Selektor
database
is the first "hybrid" thermodynamic database in a sense that
thermochemical
data and reactions are used together for any kind of geochemical
modeling
while the consistency is maintained. <br>
</p>
<p>Therefore, new thermodynamic datasets (e.g., for surface
complexation
or aqueous complexes of trace metals) can be developed using ReacDC and
reaction
log<i>K</i> values at 1 bar 25 <sup>o</sup>C using the so-called
"isoelectric/isocoulombic
reactions approach", believed to provide good extrapolation of log<i>K</i>
up to 250-300 <sup>o</sup>C (Gu et al., 1994; Kulik,2002,a,b). For
instance,
the cation exchange reaction CaCO<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup> + Cd<sup>+2</sup>
= Ca<sup>+2</sup> + CdCO<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup> can be used for
determining
standard partial molal properties of CdCO<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup>
aqueous complex from that of Cd<sup>+2</sup> and Ca<sup>+2</sup> ions
and CaCO<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup> complex, available from the Slop98.dat
dataset (Shock et al., 1997) (imported
into the default GEM-Selektor database). The above reaction is
isocoulombic
because equal number of equal charges compensate on both sides. This is
a
one-term temperature extrapolation because only log<i>K</i><sub>298</sub>
is specified, thus dGr = dHr = const, dSr = 0 and dCpr = 0 at all
temperatures.
This reaction provides a much better temperature extrapolation than a
corresponding
association reaction (Cd<sup>+2</sup> + CO<sub>3</sub><sup>-2</sup> =
CdCO<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup>)
because it actually correlates properties of CdCO<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup>
complex with those of a similar species CaCO<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup>,
while
the effects such as activity coefficients or solvation energies largely
cancel
out. <br>
</p>
<br>
<h3><a name="REACDC_CREATE"></a>1.1. Creating new ReacDC records</h3>
<p>To construct a reaction in ReacDC record, close your <a
 href="gm_project.html">modelling project</a> and switch to
"Thermodynamic
Database" mode of GEM-Selektor. There, open the "Dependent Components
(ReacDC)"
module window and execute the "Record" "Create" menu command. In the
appearing
"ReacDC: Insert a new record key" dialog, make a new <a
 href="gdb_rkey.html#dbm_ReacDC">ReacDC record key</a> (at best
selecting
one of existing keys "From List" and modifying it), and press "Ok".
This
record key also denotes a "new" dependent component to be defined in
this
ReacDC record.&nbsp; A small "ReacDC: Remake Dialog ..." will appear.
You
can read the tooltips on all the configuration fields and flags, or
click
on any of them and press <tt>F1</tt> to read help pages (available <a
 href="#REACDC_DOD_REMAKE">below in this manual</a>). Change necessary
fields
and press "Ok" to proceed. <br>
</p>
<p>The program now displays a list of available ReacDC records, asking
you
to mark the species you would like to include in your reaction. Using
the
left mouse button, mark one or more keys, or click "Clear All" if you
are
not going to use ReacDC links in defining a new ReacDC. Press "Ok" to
proceed.
Next, the program will ask you to mark the species to be included into
reaction
from the list of DComp records. Mark a few &nbsp;necessary keys and
press
"Ok" (if nothing is selected from both ReacDC and DComp record chains,
you
will see a warning dialog and will be able to repeat the whole
selection procedure).&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p> Now, you should see Page 1 of the ReacDC module window. The third
record
key field (species name) appears in the <a href="#RDname"><tt>RDname</tt></a>
field; you can enhance this comment line (recommended). The second line
(<a href="#RDform"><tt>RDform</tt></a>) is still empty, but it is
obligatory
to enter there the <a href="g_useref.html#FORMULA">chemical formula</a>
of
the "new" species. When ready, fill out a vector &nbsp;<a href="#SC_DC"><tt>SC_DC</tt></a>
of the stoichiometry coefficients of all species involved in the
reaction
(the species names in the form of DComp/ReacDC record keys are visible
in
the <a href="#REsDC"><tt>REsDC</tt></a> list to the right; the "new"
ReacDC-defined
species is always the last one in the list). The convention that
stoichiometry
coefficients of reactants are negative, and those of products are
positive
real numbers. For instance, in a reaction Cd<sup>+2</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O
= Cd(OH)<sub>2</sub>,aq + 2H<sup><sub>+</sub></sup>, stoichiometry
coefficients
are -1, -1, +1 and +2, respectively.<br>
</p>
<p>After the reaction has been formulated, you must set up its standard
properties
in <a href="#V0r_0"><tt>V0r[0]</tt></a>; <a href="#G0r_0"><tt>G0r[0]</tt></a>
or <a href="#logKr_0"><tt>logKr[0]</tt></a> or <a href="#logKr_1"><tt>logKr[1]</tt></a>;
<a href="#S0r_0"><tt>S0r[0]</tt></a> or <a href="#H0r_0"><tt>H0r[0]</tt></a>;
and <a href="#Cp0r_0"><tt>Cp0r[0]</tt></a> cells. Zeros are valid
quantities
here, and any cell with unknown data must be set as an EMPTY value (<tt>"---"</tt>
or <tt>"`"</tt>). Note that, out of three possibility of entering the
Gibbs
energy effect of the reaction: as dG0 (<a href="#G0r_0"><tt>G0r[0]</tt></a>
cell), log<i>K</i> (<a href="#logKr_1"><tt>logKr[1]</tt></a> cell), and
K
(equilibrium constant in <a href="#logKr_0"><tt>logKr[0]</tt></a>
cell),
you can use only one, and two other must be filled with EMPTY values
(they
will be automatically calculated later). Likewise, you can enter either
<a href="#S0r_0"><tt>S0r[0]</tt></a> or <a href="#H0r_0"><tt>H0r[0]</tt></a>
but another must be set EMPTY. <br>
</p>
<p>In most cases (by default), ReacDC records are set to define the
so-called
<a href="theortdb.html">3-term temperature extrapolation</a> with
dCpr(T)
= const where non-zero <a href="#S0r_0"><tt>S0r[0]</tt></a> and <a
 href="#Cp0r_0"><tt>Cp0r[0]</tt></a>&nbsp;must be known in addition to
the
Gibbs energy effect (or log<i>K</i>) of the reaction at 1 bar 25 <sup>o</sup>C.
If &nbsp;the heat-capacity effect dCpr = 0 then one has the 2-term
(Van't
Hoff ) extrapolation, and if also the entropy effect dSr =0, the 2-term
extrapolation
reduces to a 1-term one with dGr(T) =dHr(T) = const. Alternatively, if
dCpr
= 0 and dHr = 0, one obtains a 1-term extrapolation with logK(T) =
const and
non-zero dS0.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
</p>
<br>
<h3><a name="REACDC_CALCULATE"></a>1.2. ReacDC module calculations</h3>
<p>After you have entered the standard effects of the reaction (and
EMPTY
values where necessary), click on the "Calculate..." toolbar button or
press
<tt>F9</tt> or execute the "Record" "Calculate" menu command. The
program
may ask you to save the ReacDC record first (always a good idea if the
record
is just created). Which exactly calculations are to be performed and
what
input data will be used, is defined by the <a
 href="g_useref.html#TCALCMETHODCODE">method codes</a> which can be
changed
in <a href="#REACDC_DOD_REMAKE">Remake</a> mode only.</p>
<p>In a moment, you will see a complete set of standard
properties&nbsp;
for the reaction and a "new" species on Page 1. If some input data were
inconsistent
or insufficient, you will get warnings or error messages. If this is
the
case, stay on the safe side and reject insertion of calculated values,
then
check the input values and try calculation again. After successful
calculation,
you can see on Page 2 the coefficients of logK = f(T) equation (in the <a
 href="#RE_LOGK_FT"><tt>aiLgKr</tt></a> vector), computed from standard
properties
of the reaction. In the <a href="#TCint_"><tt>TCint_</tt></a> and <a
 href="#P_int"><tt>P_int</tt></a> fields to the left, enter the ranges
of
applicability of the obtained temperature/ pressure extrapolation
(usually
from 0 to 1000 bar and from 0 to 200 or 300 <sup>o</sup>C). When
finished,
save the record to database. Now, you can browse other records or
"clone"
to create a new ReacDC record. </p>
