HOW TO PRODUCE UPGRADED INSTALLATION PACKAGE OF GEMS_PSI FOR LINUX

1. Open a Linux terminal 

Check $QTDIR (if Qt is istalled):

  echo $QTDIR

QTDIR should point to ~/QtComm or another directory within
your user's home directory where you have compiled the Qt3
Commercial version for Linux. This directory should contain
a static Qt library with multithread extensions. To create 
a static lib (assuming the usual build of shared Qt libraries
was successful):

  cd $QTDIR/src
  make staticlib 

2. To update the GEMS source code tree:

  cd work/gems2
  svn update <password> 

3. Build the GEMS executable file: 

  qmake gems_qt.pro
  make

This will create an executable of the debugging version of 
GEMS-PSI (*gems2) in .~/work/gems2 subdirectory

4. Check that the actual distribution directories 
are located in work/gems2/shared/
It should look like this:
  ./shared/
           DB.default/
	   img/
	   doc/
	   data/
           projects/
      ...

#  make copy_data 
    make -f Makefile.lin copy_data 

This will refresh the configuration files.

It makes sense to re-read configuration files before 
producing the rpm package. This needs a graphic desktop
(KDE) running.

To run debugging version of GEMS, type in the terminal:
  
 cd work/gems2
 ./rungems.sh -d [-s ./shared -u ./shared]

After GEMS-PSI has started, close it. The configuration
files are now re-created.  

5. To produce a distribution rpm of GEMS-PSI release:

create makefile for release version:

qmake gems_release.pro

open another terminal and type su <root password>

#   make rpm
    make -f Makefile.lin rpm

#  you may also be prompted to enter the root password. 

This process takes some time. When finished, 
the distribution package gems-2.3.0-rc8.i586.rpm
can be copied from /usr/src/packages/RPMS/i586/. 

Alternatively (on 64bit Linux), 
the distribution package gems-2.3.0-rc8.x86-64.rpm
can be copied from /usr/src/packages/RPMS/x86-64/.
