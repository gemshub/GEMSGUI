HOW TO PRODUCE UPGRADED INSTALLATION PACKAGE OF GEMS_PSI FOR MAC

Needs Tres Thoenen's G4 Mac running 

1. Open a SSH terminal: 

  ssh guest@129.129.204.77   (password: GEM-Selektor)

Check QTDIR (if Qt is istalled):

  echo $QTDIR

  cd work/gems2
  setenv CVS_RSH ssh

2. Make update of GEMS source code tree: 

  cvs update <password> 

3. Build the release executable file: 

  make RELEASE=YES

This will create a release version of GEMS-PSI 
in ~/work/gems2.app/Contents/MacOS

4. Check that actual distribution directories stored 
in ~/work/gems2/shared/ are copied into
~/work/gems2/gems2.app/Contents/Resources.
It should look like this:
  ./gems2.app/
              Contents/
	               Resources/
		                 DB.default/
		                 img/
		                 doc/
		                 data/
                                 projects/
                ...

If necessary, use "cp -R" command to copy the five
directories listed above from ./shared/.


Execute 

  make copy_data

This will refresh configuration files.
It makes sense to re-read configuration files before 
producing the zip package. This needs a graphic desktop, 
either native or virtual.

5. To run GEMS from virtual desktop (on Linux): 

start KDE virtual desktop client for 
  129.129.204.77:0  <password for user guest>

After getting Mac desktop window, open a 
terminal there and (if not done before):

  cd ~/work/gems2
  setenv CVS_RSH ssh
  cvs update <password> 
  make RELEASE=YES 
  make copy_data

when done, re-read configuration files: 

  cd ~/work/gems2 
  ./rungems.sh -d 

and then exit GEMS. 

6. In terminal, get in ~/work/gems2/ and execute 

   make zip

This will create the archive 'gems2-mac-{current_date}.zip' 
on the current MacOS user's Desktop (if there is an existing 
zip file, it will be renamed to 
   ~/Desktop/gems2-mac-{current_date}.zip.bak).

gems2-mac-{current_date}.zip file can be distributed by 
copying it from the desktop to your (remote) location, 
e.g. for Linux as follows:

  scp guest@129.129.204.77:/Users/guest/Desktop/gems2-mac*.zip .  

and type the "guest" user's password on the prompt.
