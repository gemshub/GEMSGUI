Export&Print scripts:

Export script is processed by a CmExport method
which is executed if "RecordList" "Export"
menu command is selected.
SDref list contains a reference to "escript*:*:<rectype>:"
SDref record with the Export Script text.

Print script is processed by a CmPrint method
which is executed if "Record" "Print"
menu command is selected.
SDref list contains a reference to "pscript*:*:<rectype>:"
SDref record with the Print Script text.

Export script is executed for list of selected records,
print is executed for current record.

 type_char
 - s	Prints characters until a null-terminator

<EQUATION> =: <MSequations> prn =: <condition>;

where:


 <MSequations>    Any GEMS Math Script expressions

 <condition>      GEMS Math Script conditional expression which
                  uses line index ii and returns
			0 (prn = 0 skips line) or
			1 (prn <> 0 prints line)

 line             Command for printing one line

 list #obj_name   Command for printing as many lines as defined
                  by the first dimension (N) in the #obj_name data object

 all              Flag for printing all columns (second dimension M) from
                   #obj_name data object in the previously specified format

 label            Flag for printing DOD label for the data object #obj_name
                  in the previously specified format

 substr[index,count]  (Only for string types)
                     Flag for printing substring of string data.
                     The substring contains count characters beginning at index.

 #obj_name[i, j]   Printing values from #obj_name data object
                   in the previously specified format.
                   Where i line number, j column number.
                   ( Using only in "line command", in "list command"
                     value i is ignored )

 #obj_name[col]   Printing values from #obj_name data object
                   in the previously specified format.
                   Where line number equal 0 for "line command" and
                   equal current line numbers for "list command",
                   col column number.

 #obj_name         Printing values from #obj_name data object
                   in the previously specified format.
                   Where line number equal 0 for "line command" and
                   equal current line numbers for "list command",
                   column number equal 0 or changed if "all flag" was setted.

 space             Printing spaces  in the previously specified format.

 index             Printing current line index in the previously
                   specified format.

 rkey              Printing current record key in the previously
                   specified format.

 date              Printing current date in the previously
                   specified format.

 time              Printing current time in the previously
                   specified format.

 Any string started from $ ignored (comment line)

 Putting empty string for output as: line %s ""

Example print script "pscript:0000:gtdemo:"
--------------------------------------------------------
line %s "  GtDemo record key:", %s rkey
line %s #GDname
line %s #GDcom
line %s "  System: ", %s substr[0,42] #GD_rkl
line %s ""
line %-7s #gX_Nam, %-10.7s all #gLnam, %-10.8s "Eq.point"
line %s "--------"
list #x0 %-7.3f #x0, %-10.5f all #y0,
     %-10.7s substr[20,5] #GD_rkl
line %s "--------"
