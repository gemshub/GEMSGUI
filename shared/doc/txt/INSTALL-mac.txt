Installation procedure for MacOS version of GEMS-PSI

-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. To install on Mac G3, G4 or G5 with MacOS X 10.2 or later, 
   drop the distribution file to your user's desktop and double-click 
   on the icon. The file will be unzipped into the bundle
     /Applications/gems2.app.

2. To start GEMS-PSI, double-click on its icon now appearing 
on the desktop. 

At the first start of gems2, the default project(s) will be 
automatically copied into your user's home directory.

  Default directories on Mac OS X:
    Program:	                ./gems2.app/Contents/Resources
    User's data (projects):	~/Library/gems2
    
NOTE: the application bundle on MacOS desktop should be called 'gems2',
otherwise it will not be able to find the gems program files.

3. To upgrade the already installed GEMS2 package:

  First, drag the start gems2 icon to Trash, or, using Finder, 
  find the whole GEMS2 program bundle /gems2.app in the 
  Applications directory and delete it. 
 
  Proceed with the new release zip file of GEMS2, as described 
  above. Your user's data (modelling projects) in your home 
  directory will remain unchanged.
