<h4>
Technical data</h4>
Known to be compiled and work on RedHat Linux 6.1/Intel, FreeBSD 3.3/Intel,
Solaris 7 on Intel and Sparc
<br>The work is being done to complete Win32 version - excpeted to end
in Febrary 2000.
<p>GEMS is compiled using EGCS-1.1.2 (or with GCC-2.95.2 with some patches)
for Unix platforms and Borland C++ 5.4 compiler (C++ Builder 4) for Win32
(need some patches).
<br>For Unices all one have to do is modify Makefile.common to correct
paths to QT include and libs, and probably set compiler and linker names.
For BorlandC++/Win32 special set of makefiles used as 'make' here differs
a lot.
<p>GEMS sources are about 45000 line of code written in C++.
<br>GUI&nbsp;part depends on QT library from Troll Tech (www.troll.no);
GEMS core depends on <b>string</b> and <b>auto_ptr </b>class from C++&nbsp;STL
library and uses templates.
<p>GEMS occupies about 7MB of RAM
<br>With initial database GEMS requiers about 7MB on hard drive
<br>Pentium 133 or better should be fine for Intels.
<br>We hope you have at least 256 color in your X Window System. :-)
<p>GEMS RPM installs gems executable in /usr/bin and support and DB files
in /usr/lib/gems.
