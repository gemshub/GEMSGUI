<h2>&nbsp;<a name="MAINTAIN"></a>6. GEMS Database Maintenance menu
commands and functions</h2>
<p> </p>
<h4> <br>
<tt></tt></h4>
From the "<tt>Thermodynamic database</tt>" dialog window, press any of
the
buttons for data types (e.g. <tt>Dependent Components (Thermochemical)</tt>).&nbsp;
A sreenform will appear ("<tt>DComp</tt>" in this case) with some data
fields,
a menu bar, buttons and pictograms, common for all screenforms
accessible
in the <i>database maintenance</i> mode. On screenforms, the key of
the record
currently visible in the screen form is shown, with date and time of
the
last modification. Some screenforms consist of more than one page; in
this
case, you will see two or more buttons labeled "<tt>Page1</tt>", "<tt>Page2</tt>",
... The buttons with pictograms just duplicate the most frequently used
options
from the pop-up menus.
<p>The&nbsp;<a name="P333R"></a>"<b>Record</b>" menu provides commands
for
processing data in a single record; these commands are briefly
described below. </p>
<p><a name="P333R1"></a><b><i>Show</i></b> <br>
Permits to select a single record from database and display it in the
screen
form. When this command is executed, a "<tt>Select data record key</tt>"
dialog
appears with a scroll list of record keys (in alphabetic order). Select
the
one you need by mouse-click and press the "<tt>OK</tt>" button. The
lists
in DCOMP or REACDC chains may be quite long and you can display only
part
of record keys by using the "<tt>Filter...</tt>" button.&nbsp; If you
press
it, a small "Template" dialog appears with record key fields usually
containing
asterisks (meaning that any string fits to the template). You can edit
some
fields by putting letters in them; for instance (if you work with DCOMP
records),
putting "a" in the first field and "Fe*" in the second one creates a
template
which will display only aqueous species of iron. Press OK when
finished;
the template is retained until another template is specified, "Select
All"
button restores the default template (fits with any record key).&nbsp;
Most
of data fields can be edited in this mode. The program usually detects
that
some data objects have been modified by the user and will display
warning
messages if you try to load another record from the database before
contents
of the modified record had been saved. </p>
<p><a name="P333R2"></a><b><i>Remake</i></b> <br>
Re-structurises and rebuilds the currently selected record. This
function is highly specific for record types and is the most
sophisticated tool for
handling data in GEMS. In general, after the "Remake" button is
pressed, a
small "Reorganization of data fields" dialog appears with three
options: "Clear
all" (restores an empty default configuration of data structure);
"Remake"
and "Bypass" (leaves the data structure unchanged). The first two
options
will get you in a "Configuration dialog", sometimes with many flags and
switches.
In most cases, these flags refer to dynamic data objects, allocated if
the
flag is set to "*" or "+" and deleted if the flag is set to "-".&nbsp;
Other
flags contain codes for various calculation modes (<a
 href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6500">more for DCOMP and REACDC</a>).
Please,
note that these configuration flags can be changed only in the "Remake"
mode
to prevent possible crashes of the dynamic memory because of mismatches
caused
by changing the flags at runtime. </p>
<p><a name="P333R3"></a><b><i>Create</i></b> <br>
Creates a new database record (this is a main tool for "cloning"
records of
the same structure in GEMS database). When invoked, it first displays a
"Insert
new database record" dialog with a disassembled key of the currently
loaded
record. You should change at list one character in one of the fields
and
press "OK". The record key must be unique! An error message will occur
if
the record with the same key as you have specified exists in the
database. When the new record is created, the command execution will
proceed exactly as the Remake command. </p>
<p><a name="P333R4"></a><b><i>Calculate</i></b> <br>
Many record types (COMPOS, DCOMP, REACDC, RTPARM, PHASE) are tied with
various
subroutines which perform cross-checking of the data, restore missing
values,
or do other calculations. These subroutines of GEMS are executed upon
"Calculate"
command. They can issue a variety of warnings depending on the data and
the
record type. The calculated data are not saved automatically to the
database;
this has to be done using "Save" or "Save as" commands. </p>
<p><a name="P333R5"></a><b><i>Save</i></b> <br>
Saves current record to the database file from where it has been
loaded. </p>
<p><a name="P333R6"></a><b><i>Save as</i></b> <br>
Permits to save contents of the data record under another record key
(works
as "Create" command except that no re-organization of the data
structure is
performed). If more than one file is linked to the database chain, this
command
will display a dialog with all files listed and the user will have to
select
a file where to put the record. Please, remember that the default GEMS
database
files are write-protected, so normally you should choose only between
files
existing in your own system profile directories. </p>
<p><a name="P333R7"></a><b><i>Delete</i></b> <br>
Deletes currently displayed record from the database chain. The
contents of
the record remain loaded into memory and in principle can be saved
using "Save
As" or "Create" commands. This operation will not work on
write-protected files from the default GEMS database. </p>
<p><a name="P333R8"></a><b><i>Plot</i></b> <br>
This function works only in RTPARM and GTDEMO screen forms. After
calculation, it will display four graphs (one in GTDEMO) to examine
temperature and /
or pressure change of selected thermodynamic properties. </p>
<p><a name="P333R9"></a><b><i>Print</i></b> <br>
This function is still under construction. For some data types (e.g.,
RTPARM
or PHASE), it can print tabulated data or download them as columns of
numbers
into a text file. A typical "File Selection" dialog appears to let you
choose
the file name and path. </p>
<p><b><i>Demo</i></b> <br>
Under construction. </p>
<p><b><i>Close</i></b> <br>
Closes the screen form and returns to "Thermodynamic Database" dialog. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a name="P333L"></a>"<b>Record List</b>" menu provides
commands for processing multiple records; a brief description of its
its commands follows. </p>
<p><a name="P333L1"></a><b><i>Browse</i></b> <br>
This command permits to scan one-by-one all or some records in the
database
chain and load one for your choice.&nbsp; First, it displays a "Get Key
Template"
dialog&nbsp; which works similar to that described in "<a href="#P333R1">Show</a>"
command. When the record key template is constructed and "OK" button is
pressed,
you will see the screen form with contents of the first record and
(outside
of it) a small "Select this record" window with record key shown in the
status
line. The "Next" and "Previous" buttons let you walk through the
sequence
of selected records; "Select" button will change the program to "Show
record"
mode. </p>
<p><a name="P333L2"></a><b><i>Move</i></b> <br>
Moves one or several records (with record keys that fit the template)
into
another database file which has to be linked before executing this
command.
First, this command shows "Get Key Template" dialog and then, on each
record,
displays the "File Selection Dialog". This command can be applied only
to
records kept in the users's extension files, but not in the default
database
files. </p>
<p><a name="P333L3"></a><b><i>Delete</i></b> <br>
Deletes several records from the (user extension) database files.
First, it
shows the "Get Key Template" dialog (multiple selection of record keys
is
allowed) and then requests separate confirmation for deletion of each
record.
Remember that deleted records can not be restored in GEMS database! The
records
are not physically erased - only their keys are eliminated from the
index
files. The deleted record will occupy place inside of the .pdb file and
a
reference to this space will be created in the header of the .pdb file.
When
the next record is inserted it can overwrite part of this space. Since
the
size of PDB file header is limited, it may happen that stack of deleted
records
will overflow, with the respective warning message. In this case, <a
 href="#P333F4">compression of database file</a> should be performed. A
good
rule of thumb is not to delete more than 20-30 records at once. </p>
<p><a name="P333L4"></a><b><i>List</i></b> <br>
Creates a text file with alphabetic list of record keys in the database
chain.
First, this command shows "Get Key Template" dialog to&nbsp; do a
(multiple)
selection of record keys, and then displays the "File Selection
Dialog". </p>
<p><a name="P333L5"></a><b><i>Export...</i></b> <br>
Unloads records from database chain into GEMS backup format text files.
First,
this command shows "Get Key Template" dialog (multiple selection of
record
keys is possible) and then the "File Selection Dialog". The records can
be
exported all at once or viewed with confirmation for exporting&nbsp;
each
record.&nbsp; This is a good tool to backup your database extension
files
or copy large parts of the default thermodynamic database into your
profile
database files. The unloaded text files can be edited with any text
editor
and imported back into GEMS database extension files. </p>
<p><a name="P333L6"></a><b><i>Import...</i></b> <br>
Loads records from a (previously exported) GEMS backup format text file
to
the user's extension database file(s) which must be linked in advance.
First,
this command displays the "File Selection Dialog" to find the input
text
file, and then will require to choose a database file where to put each
record
if more than one file is linked. It is possible to display contents of
each
imported record before deciding whether to put it into the database
file. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a name="P333F"></a>"<b>Files</b>"&nbsp; menu&nbsp;
contains commands
for manipulation with GEMS database files. Each database chain for a
given
data type is physically represented by several pairs of files with
identical
file names but different extensions. For a given &lt;name&gt;, there
are
two physical disk files: &lt;name&gt;.pdb (data record file) and
&lt;name&gt;.ndx
(record index file). Note that all information, including record keys
and
time of last modification, is recorded in the &lt;name&gt;.pdb file.
The
corresponding &lt;name&gt;.ndx file, if corrupt, can be restored by
execution
of&nbsp; "<a href="#P333F4">Rebuild Index</a>" command (this may take a
few
minutes). </p>
<p><a name="P333F1"></a><b><i>Actualize Files</i></b> <br>
Permits the user to alter the current configuration of files linked to
the
database chain. First, it shows a list of all files available in both
default
and user's extension database, with the previously linked files already
selected.
Use mouse clicks to select/dismiss the files. Press OK when finished.
All
linked files will open automatically and .ndx indices will merge into
the
chain record key index in the program memory. </p>
<p><a name="P333F2"></a><b><i>Link File</i></b> <br>
Links a file (not yet selected) to the database chain; previously
linked files
remain linked too.&nbsp; Works similar to "Actualize" command. </p>
<p><a name="P333F3"></a><b><i>Add Files</i></b> <br>
Adds&nbsp; GEMS database files to file configuration or creates empty
database
files. Proceeds from the "File Selection Dialog".&nbsp; For developers
or
experienced user's only! </p>
<p><a name="P333F4"></a><b><i>Rebuild Index</i></b> <br>
This database support function compresses a selected database file to
eliminate
the "deleted" spaces in .pdb binary file, and rebuilds its index .ndx
file.
Choose one or several files from the list and press OK. For large
files,
this may take several minutes or more. <br>
Warning: compression is a radical operation which, in case of failure
or
interruption, can make the database file unusable and cause large loss
of
data. We advice always making a backup copy or unload the file to text
format
before compression. If an error has occurred during compression (with
error
message), we recommend to quit GEMS, replace the file with its its
backup
copy (or <br>
delete it to create a new empty file and load the records from
previously unloaded text format); then start GEMS and resume operation.

<h4> <tt>3.3.10. Advanced Database Maintenance
Dialog</tt></h4>
What to do if you decided to type in some bibliographic references, or
delete
some SysEq records because you do not need them anymore, or compress
your
extension database files with SysEq, Process or GTdemo records? This
can
be done in the same way as described above for <a href="#P3300">thermodynamic
database</a> records if you open a "<tt>Database Management (Advanced)</tt>"
dialog. To do it, first go from the Main Dialog of GEMS&nbsp; into the "<tt>Thermodynamic
Database</tt>"&nbsp; dialog, and then press the "<tt>Advanced</tt>"
button.
The appearing dialog is pretty similar to the "<tt>Thermodynamic
Database</tt>"&nbsp;
dialog; select one of the necessary data types (e.g., <tt>Thermodynamic
Systems</tt>)&nbsp;
and you will get in a screen form of the same type and with the same
set
of pop-up menus as described <a href="#P3330">previously</a>.&nbsp;
Use the
appropriate <a href="#P333R">menu commands</a> to do the work
(however, don't
try to delete Profile records or Create/Remake/Edit&nbsp; SysEq, Proces
or
GTDEMO records as it could be done only in Calculation of Equilibria
mode!).
"Uncertainty Space", "Dual Thermodynamics" and "Mass Transport" data
types
and algorithms are under construction and not available in this version
of
GEMS. Press "<tt>Back</tt>" or "<tt>Basic</tt>" buttons to get back to "<tt>Thermodynamic
Database</tt>" dialog. <br>
