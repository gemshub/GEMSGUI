<h3><a name="WHATIS_PROJECT"></a>What is a GEMS modelling project?<br>
    </h3>
       
<p>A modelling project is actually a sub-directory that contains a set of
  GEMS database         files that &nbsp;keep a "template" definition of
the   chemical system,     all    the necessary input thermodynamic and composition
  data records,  as   well  as  (input and calculated) data for many particular
  equilibrium  systems   with   optional Process Simulator and Graphic/tabulated
  Data Sampler  records.   Any GEM   calculations of thermodynamic equilibria
  can only be performed  in the  context   of a currently open modelling
project.   To open or create a project, get into the "Modelling Projects"
dialog by  pressing the "Computation     of Equilibria"   button on the Main
Dialog.  <br>
    </p>
       
<p>Location of the <tt>/projects</tt> directory (where all projects will
be stored as subdirectories) is defined by the &nbsp;<tt>-u</tt> &nbsp;command
  line parameter of gems2 executable file (you can see this location in the
  <a href="gemsetup.html">Preferences Dialog</a>). For instance, <tt>"-u
D:\GEMS2inst"</tt>   in the command line tells the program to look for existing
projects and to  store a newly-created project <tt>"MyProject"</tt> in <tt>"D:\GEMS2inst\projects\MyProject"</tt>
  directory. This new project is as a collection of database files, all containing
  <tt>"MyProject"</tt> as a file name element. &nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    </p>
       
<h3><a name="MODE_SETUP"></a>Project creation mode setup<br>
    </h3>
       
<p>When creating a new project, the program will use the Default database
  files, located in the <tt>"/program/DB.default"</tt> directory. When gems2
  executable code starts, it looks for the <tt>"/program"</tt> directory
following   a specification by the &nbsp;<tt>-s</tt> command line parameter
(you can  see this location in the <a href="gemsetup.html">Preferences Dialog</a>).
 For instance, <tt>"-s D:\GEMS2inst\program"</tt> in the command line tells
 that the Default database files are located in&nbsp; <tt>"D:\GEMS2inst\program\DB.default"</tt>
  directory.<br>
    </p>
       
<p>There are two main types of modelling projects (and, accordingly, two
project setup modes) that can be selected in the<a href="gemsetup.html">
Preferences Dialog</a>.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
       
<p><a name="PROJECT_LINKED"></a>One "linked" type (used in version 1 of GEM-Selector)
  links selected default database files to the project during its whole lifetime.
  When any equilibria are calculated, the input phase definitions and thermodynamic
  data are collected directly from default database files; only records added
  by the user (or created by modelling calculations) will be stored in the
 project database files. <br>
    </p>
       
<p><a name="PROJECT_INDEPENDENT"></a>Another "standalone" type (default and 
 recommended in GEM-Selektor v.2-PSI) links default database files to project 
 only at the stage of its creation or upgrade. The Default database is searched 
 for all species and phases records conforming with the chosen list of Independent 
 Components and other selection criteria in the <a href="elements.html">ElementsDialog</a>, 
 and such records are immediately copied into the project database file. When
 creation of the project is finished, all Default database files (except SDref
 script and bibliography files) are disconnected &nbsp;and the project becomes
 standalone, - <i>independent</i> of the Default database. During the project
 lifetime, the user can change, delete or add any phase definition, PCO or
 thermodynamic data records at her/his discretion. Such projects will not
be affected by any future changes or extensions of the Default database and
can be exchanged between different users. Another advantage is that the system
 template in an independent project is relatively small and easier to observe
 because it involves only part of the Default database. <br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    </p>
         
<h3> <a name="CREATE_PROJECT"></a>Creating a new project</h3>
                                       To create a <a
 href="#PROJECT_INDEPENDENT">standalone project</a>, get into the "Modelling
  projects" dialog and click the "New  Project"     button. This will bring
  you to a small "Enter a new record key" dialog. Type a short project name
  instead of "MyWork" (or click "From List" to pick up one of existing Project
  record keys and modify it); change the comment line (spaces are not allowed),
  and press         "Ok".&nbsp;                                     
<p>This will bring you to a large <a href="elements.html">Elements Dialog</a>
  that looks like the Periodic Table. Select necessary elements (and other
 Independent Components) and press "Ok" when ready. If GEM-Selektor asks
you  about the <tt>DiscardedRecords.txt</tt>  file, tell it to overwrite
   - this diagnostic file shows which multi-component phase definitions were
not copied into the project database because some of their species failed
to confirm with selection criteria. Next, a small "Select an aqueous activity
model" dialog will appear; choose the appropriate model and then choose the
gas mixture model in the next dialog. After a few seconds, you should see
  the    "Gibbs  Energy Minimization Modelling Project" dialog, the same
as   if you    would see just  after opening an existing project. This means
that your new project&nbsp;     has been succesfully created; it can be closed
 and opened  as any other  existing   project. To close, press the "Back"
button to get  back to the GEM-Selektor   Main Dialog. Now you can click
on "Computation of Equilibria", get to the "Modelling Projects" dialog, and
open the newly-created project by selecting its name in the list and pressing
"Ok" (or double-clicking on the list entry). <br>
                   </p>
                                                                        
         
<p> </p>
         
<p>It is less simple to create a new <a href="#PROJECT_LINKED">"linked" project</a> 
 because in this case, you cannot use the ElementsDialog and you must know 
 what is contained in various Default database files in order to make a proper 
 selection. It is recommended to proceed in the following steps  creating 
such a new project. </p>
         
<p>   </p>
     
<ol>
     <li>               
    <p> Define the list of independent components (IC) necessary for describing
   stoichiometry of the system. Find out which IComp database files contain 
 records for all required independent components. Define which phase types 
 (aqueous, gas, solid (solutions), sorption)  must be included. Check which 
 GEMS default  thermodynamic database files are to be linked to your new project.</p>
     </li>
     <li>               
    <p>Start GEM-Selektor&nbsp;and go into "Computation of Equilibria" mode. 
 Select a radio-button called "Make a new project by linking files from the 
 default database", then click on the "New Project..." button to create a 
new linked project.</p>
     </li>
     <li>               
    <p>In the appearing small dialog, enter the new Project record key and 
 press "Ok". Now, a "Database File Configuration for Modelling Project" dialog 
 appears. Expand the "Database" entry and then expand the "Kernel" entry. 
There, expand one-by-one the "sdref", "icomp", "dcomp", "compos", "reacdc" 
and "phase" entries and in each of them, right-click necessary files to link 
them to the project. Press "Ok" when finished, and confirm your file selection 
by clicking on the "Yes/Proceed" button.&nbsp;</p>
     </li>
     <li>               
    <p>In the appearing "Select an aqueous activity model" dialog, select 
 the desired model; next, do so in the appearing "gas mixture model" dialog. 
 You should see the&nbsp;"Gibbs  Energy Minimization Modelling Project" dialog; 
 from now on, the project is created and you can create &nbsp;and model chemical 
 systems equilibria and store them in SysEq records.&nbsp; </p>
     </li>
     
</ol>
     
<p>    </p>
     
<p>    </p>
     
<p>    </p>
     
<p>    </p>

<blockquote> What the program did when it created a new project? 
  <p>Let us take a look at what the program has done. Switch to your favourite
         file manager and find there the directory where you have installed
  the    GEM-Selektor   (for instance, ~<tt>/gems2test</tt> ). In this directory,
     find a <tt>~/gems2test/projects/Carbonat</tt>   subdirectory that has
 just    been created for the "Carbonate" project files.   Dive into this

  <p>The binary GEMS database file, as such, has a <tt>.pdb</tt> file name
        extension; the file with the same name but a <tt>.ndx</tt> extension
    contains     indexing information (record keys with references to record
   location in   the    <tt>.pdb</tt> file) to speed up search in the database.
   The second   element  of the file name is always the same as the profile
  directory name   (<tt>Carbonat</tt>).  The first element of the file name
  is a GEM-Selektor   module name that can  process the records stored in
the  database file. In   the left column, all files keeping the project input
 thermodynamic and composition   data are shown. In the right column, the
file <tt>projec.Carbonat.pdb</tt>   keeps the project  system structure lists
and configuration (one record   <tt>"Carbonat:My1stProject"</tt>    ); the
file <tt>syseq.Carbonat.pdb</tt>&nbsp;will  collect all the calculated  
 CSD and equilibrium state records (still empty).    <br>
 </p>
  <p>                 Files&nbsp;<tt>proces.Carbonat.pdb</tt> and <tt>gtdemo.Carbonat.pdb</tt>&nbsp;
         will contain your Project Simulator and Graphic/table Demo Sampler
  records,       respectively, and <tt>sdref.Carbonat.pdb</tt> file will
keep   your SDref     records  with bibliographic data or customized scripts.
These   files are   also  empty  at present. <br>
                    </p>
  <p>Note that all your work done on this modelling project will be stored
        exclusively into <tt>.pdb</tt> files in the project directory, and
  nowhere       else. Thus, you can backup your work any time simply by zipping
  the whole      project directory; this zip file (e.g. <tt>Carbonat.zip</tt>)
  can be sent     to your colleague with whom you would like to share your
 models. You are    welcome to send it&nbsp; also to the developers of GEM-Selektor
    in the case   of bug reporting or if you wish to contribute to the GEMS
  Kernel   database,    test suite, or tutorials. <br>
                    </p>
  <p>As seen in the left column of the above table, <tt>icomp.*, dcomp.*,
        reacdc.*, phase.*</tt> and <tt>compos.*</tt> files in the project
directory        are not empty. During creation of the new project, GEM-Selektor
used   the    list of selected independent components&nbsp;Ca, Mn, Fe, C,
Na, Cl,   O, H,   Zz &nbsp;first to copy the respective IComp records to
  <tt>icomp.Carbonat.pdb</tt>         file. Then the program searched the
whole accessible part of default database for such Dependent       Components
and compositions that would completely fit into this stoichiometry      
basis; the conforming DComp, ReacDC, and Compos records were also copied
     from default to project database files. Next, the program checked all
the    Phase definitions available in the default database against the lists
of  copied  DComp and ReacDC records and discarded all phases that contain
at  least one  species not conformant with the project system stoichiometry
basis.  The record  keys of discarded multi-component phases have been written
to  the diagnostic&nbsp;<tt>DiscardedRecords.txt</tt>      file (located
in the  directory from where you have started the program). This file   
can be used for checking  which phase definitions can be copied later&nbsp;
manually  to  the project and rebuilt  there (instead of creating them from
scratch)  to extend the modelling systems.     <br>
                    </p>
                  Finally, the program has assembled the definitions of aqueous 
 and   gas   phases    from the DComp and ReacDC records previously copied 
 into  the project   database,    and attached all Phase record keys and all
 the  DComp/ReacDC  record keys  referenced  from the phase definitions to
 the project system  structure. Note  that those  records for Dependent Components
 that were not  referenced in any Phase definition  copied into the project,
 were not included  in the project  system. To activate  such Dependent Components
  (e.g., minerals),   you will  have to create Phase  records for them in
the  "Thermodynamic Database"   mode  and then open the project,  which will
be  extended automatically. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <br>
  <br>
                    In your new project directory, the program has created
 several     empty    files (for <tt>rtparm, sdref, proces, gtdemo</tt> and
   <tt>syseq</tt> modules) to  store  the   records that you are going to
create when working in the modelling project.    Though   one database file
per module is present in the project directory,    you always can   create
new files (as described in the <a href="gems_gdb.html">Database   Management
   manual</a>). In doing so, we would recommend  to add another part to the
  file name, for   example,   <tt>reacdc.Carbonat.MySpecies.pdb</tt>  or
  <tt>reacdc.Carbonat.MyPCO.pdb</tt>.      Note that records in these additional
 files will not be visible to the   project   system definition until you
  <a href="gemstart.html#GSM_EXTEND_PROJECT">reconfigure   the   project</a>.
It would be wise  to have some additional thermodynamic   database   files
never linked to the  project system definition, just kept   for some supplementary
 data or calculations;  anyway, the files reside in  the project directory
and  will not be lost during backups.&nbsp; <br>

<h4>3.4.1. Extending the Project Thermodynamic Database</h4>
      &nbsp;To add chemical species and phases to your project database 
extension  files, first close the "Single Thermodynamic System" dialog and
switch into  the "Thermodynamic Database" mode of GEM-Selektor. Bear in mind
the following  recommendations. <br>
     &nbsp;      
<ul>
      <li> It is always easier to use existing records from the default database 
  (loaded with "Show" command) as templates for creating  new records with 
 "Save As..." or "Create" menu commnads.</li>
       <li> Create records in your profile database extension in the following 
  order: <a href="gm_icomp.html">IComp</a>; <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a>; 
     <a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a>; <a href="gm_phase.html">Phase</a>; 
     <a href="gm_compos.html">Compos</a>.</li>
       <li> After remaking <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a>;&nbsp; <a
 href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC,</a>  and <a href="gm_compos.html">Compos</a> 
 records, it's advisable to re-calculate them.</li>
       <li> Back-up your newly created or modified database records by exporting 
 them into text files.</li>
       <li> If you need to copy many records from default database to your
 database   extension file, <a href="#P333L5">export</a> them first to a
text  file. Then edit this text file for changing the last field of record
keys  to avoid possible "duplicate record key" errors. Finally, <a
 href="#P333F1">link</a> your profile extension file only and <a
 href="#P333L6">import</a> records from the edited text file.</li>

<h4>3.4.2. Configuring Database Files</h4>
      The current configuration of link files for the entire database is
saved    into a <tt>~/GEMS/gems.cfg </tt>file every time when&nbsp; <tt>Yes</tt>&nbsp;
   button is pressed in the "Save current configuration?" dialog upon exiting
   GEMS.&nbsp; The file configuration from&nbsp; <tt>~/GEMS/gems.cfg </tt>is
   automatically activated at start of the next GEMS session. For each database
   chain, all linked&nbsp; *.ndx&nbsp; files are opened and merged into one
  index (alphabetic list of record keys), kept in the program memory until
 any command from the "<a href="#P333F">Files</a>" menu is executed or a
system   profile is opened (in both cases, all chain indexes are re-organized).
The   file configuration specific to a system profile is stored in the Profile
 record; the only requirement is that the profile file configuration is a
subset of main (<tt>gems.cfg</tt>) configuration.      
<p>What to do if you received an archived system profile developed by a colleague 
  of yours and wish to work with it? First, unpack the whole profile directory 
  into your&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>~/GEMS/profiles</tt>&nbsp; directory. Then change 
  owner of all files in this new directory to your login name (best is to 
select  all files in the Midnight Commander panel and execute its "File" "Chown"
menu command). Then change to your home directory and execute <tt>gems -c</tt>&nbsp;
 from command line. Exit GEMS with saving file configuration. Start GEMS
as  usual and select "Calculation of Equilibria" mode. You should see the
system  profile of your colleague in the list&nbsp; - select it and continue
to work.  <br>

<h3> <a name="FIRST_SYSTEM"></a>Creating a First SysEq Record in the Project</h3>
       
<p>  The last step to make a fully functional project is to create a first
  CSD (chemical system definition) record of <a href="gm_syseq.html">SysEq</a>
  type. In the "Gibbs        Energy Minimization Modelling Project" dialog
 (where you get after creating or opening a project), press the button "Single-System
        Equilibria (SysEq)". The program will show the&nbsp;"Single Thermodynamic
  System" dialog and, if it detects that there are no SysEq records in the
 project directory, it will automatically start creating a new record and
you will see an <a
 href="file:///C:/gems2html/program/doc/html/gemstart.html#GSM_ENKEY_DIALOG">"Enter
  new key" dialog</a>. Check the CSD name, temperature and pressure there
and  press "Ok" to proceed.&nbsp;You will see a "Remake Dialog" (will be
replaced  by a System Remake Wizard in future GEMS versions).&nbsp;<small><font
 size="+1"><small> the default flags are Ok and should be changed very seldomly. 
  It is only advisable to enter two comment lines identifying your new system
  and press "Ok" to continue. </small></font><font size="+1"
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small><br>
     </small></font></small> </p>
       
<p><small><font size="+1"><small>This will allocate the dynamic memory objects
  and display a <big><a href="gems_sys.html"><small>"Single Thermodynamic
System"  Dialog</small></a> <small>- the main tool for setting up and configuring
 a particular chemical system definition within a framework of the modelling
  project. </small></big></small></font></small></p>
       
<p> </p>
    <small><font size="+1"><small>In principle, the only thing you still
have   to do in order to complete the chemical system definition is to specify
a  "recipe" for the total bulk composition of the system. This can be done
in  many ways, but the easiest one is to click on the "Bulk Composition"
&nbsp;<img src="SetCompos.png" alt="SetComposButton" width="21"
 height="22">
      toolbar button. This will open the </small></font></small>"System"
module   window, which serves for a detailed setup of the model chemical
system. The  "Compos"  page <small><font size="+1"><small>offers you an 
easiest way to  express your "recipe". This creative process is described
in more detail in the <a href="gemstart.html">"GEMS Getting Started" manual</a>.
After you have defined the chemical system, proceed to calculation of its
total bulk composition </small></font></small>(click upon a "Calculate bulk
composition" &nbsp;<img src="RunBCC.png" alt="RunBCC button" width="20"
 height="20">
         toolbar button) and, if the program does not complain, to computing
  the equilibrium state (click on a "Calculate equilibrium" <img
 src="RunIPM.png" alt="Run IPM button" width="20" height="20">
        &nbsp; toolbar button). This will start the GEM IPM module, and display 
   an IPM Progress Dialog. After IPM converges, press the "Accept" button 
to save the complete SysEq record to project database.&nbsp;  <br>

<h3><a name="OPEN_PROJECT"></a>Opening an existing project<br>
    </h3>
       
<p>In "Modelling projects" dialog, all existing projects are    listed  
 in the upper part of the dialog window; below, some important   switches
  and   buttons are located (see &nbsp;<a

          &nbsp;file for details).&nbsp;<br>
                     </p>
                                      To open an existing project, just select
  its <a
 href="file:///C:/gems2html/program/doc/html/gdb_rkey.html#dbm_Project">record
  key</a> in the list (for example,         "Testsuite:GEMS-PSIv2_0_0") and
  double-click on it or press the "Open     Project"    button.  This (after
  a few seconds) will get you in a Project     &lt;name&gt;    "Gibbs Energy
  Minimization Modelling Project" dialog, where    &lt;name&gt;   of the
project   (in this case, "Testsuite") is taken from  the  first field  of
the Project   record key. The same name is given to the  project  directory
 <tt>.../projects/&lt;name&gt;</tt>   and is part of any  file name  in this
directory.  From this dialog, you  can proceed to GEM modelling  in  a single
chemical system  or to simulation  of irreversible  chemical transfer   
processes as sequences  of local/partial   equilibrium  states. <br>
