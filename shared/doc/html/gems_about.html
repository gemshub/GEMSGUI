<h3> <a name="OVERVIEW"></a>OVERVIEW</h3>
This chapter is for people who have never used&nbsp; GEM-Selektor
or other Gibbs energy minimisation codes, and, perhaps, have never done
geochemical modelling. If you are already familiar with the subject and
just try to learn a particular feature or technical information, you
can
probably skip three sections below. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<p> </p>
<h3> <a name="WHATIS"></a>What is GEM-Selektor?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p> GEM-Selektor (GEMS) is a broad-purpose <b><i>geochemical
modelling code</i></b>. It uses an advanced convex programming method
of Gibbs energy minimization (GEM) implemented in an efficient Interior
Points Method (IPM) numerical module. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using GEMS, you can compute <b><i>equilibrium phase assemblage
and speciation</i></b> in a complex chemical system from its total bulk
elemental composition at given temperature and pressure (optionally,
with some metastability or kinetic constraints). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chemical interactions involving (dispersed) solids, solid
solutions, gas mixture, aqueous electrolyte&nbsp; (non-)electrostatic
surface complexation, and ion exchange can be considered simultaneously
in the chemical elemental stoichiometry (+ electrical charge) of the
system, i.e. <b><i>without any additional mass balance constraints</i></b>
for ligands or surface sites. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GEMS package comes with a built-in write-protected default <b><i>chemical
thermodynamic data base,</i><i> </i></b>selected parts of which are
automatically copied into your<b><i> &nbsp;modelling project data base</i></b>
. There thermodynamic and compositional input data are immediately
available for calculation of equilibrium states. In principle, all you
have to do is to provide the bulk composition of your system and,
possibly, exclude some irrelevant or metastable species and
phases.&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If necessary, the standard-state thermodynamic data will be
automatically <i><b>converted to temperature/ pressure of interest</b></i>
&nbsp;before computing the equilibrium state using several techniques
appropriate for soilds, gases, aqueous and surface species.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using GEMS, you can simulate<b><i> various irreversible
mass-transfer processes</i></b>, such as titrations, mixing,
weathering, or sequential reactors, from <b><i>principles of local and
partial equilibrium, </i></b>controlled by a "process extent" master
variable(s) used in the <i><b>process simulator math scripts</b></i>.
Results of such "process simulations" can easily be tabulated, plotted
(also during calculations), or printed into text files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to the common <i><b>"primal solution"</b></i> of
the GEM problem (equilibrium chemical speciation), the IPM algorithm
always calculates a "<b><i>dual solution</i></b>"&nbsp; - chemical
potentials of stoichiometry units (elements) at equilibrium state. By
comparing primal and dual solutions, it becomes possible to retrieve pe
(Eh), pH, fugacities of gases, very low activities or concentrations,
as well as to estimate unknown thermodynamic properties for end-members
in solid solution - aqueous solution systems. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
Overall, using the GEMS code, you will
have the power of advanced chemical thermodynamic modelling at your
fingertips, and will eventually achieve an unmatched efficiency in
interpreting
even complex subsurface- or hydrothermal aquatic systems. Of course,
you will need to sacrifice some time and effort required for learning
new concepts and some training. To make it easier, we strive to provide
a set of <b><i>test problems and tutorials</i></b> in the forthcoming
releases.<br>

<h3> <a name="WHATISNOT"></a>What is GEM-Selektor not?</h3>
<big> GEMS can do a lot of things for you, but it cannot be everything
for everyone.</big>
<p><big>GEMS cannot replace knowledge of physical chemistry.</big> </p>
<blockquote>It's hardly possible to set up meaningful problems in
geochemical thermodynamic modelling and interprete results without a
good basic <b><i>understanding of aquatic chemistry and chemical
thermodynamics</i></b>, even though the underlying concepts are very
general and quite simple. Taking a course in the above subjects and/or
reading a few good textbooks such as (Anderson and Crerar, 1993;
Nordstrom and Munos, 1994; Stumm and Morgan, 1996) would be therefore a
valuable investment, helping you to get maximum from the usage of GEMS
package at later times.</blockquote>
<big> GEMS is not a substitute for creative research.</big>
<blockquote>Geochemical thermodynamic modelling (as almost any
modelling) should be regarded as nothing else than a <b><i>tool</i></b>
&nbsp;which helps you in interpreting your geochemical data and in
reaching a deeper understanding of how the chemical system works. As
any tool, GEMS can be used either in a creative or in a destructive
way.&nbsp;</blockquote>
<big> GEMS cannot formulate chemical modelling problems and interprete
results</big>.
<blockquote>Very often, first GEMS runs on your model yield rather
unexpected results, telling you that some of your concepts have to be
reconsidered. This is normal; a few more modeling iterations will soon
give you much more confidence in your data and model predictions. What
really makes no sense, is to start modeling something just having the
raw data, without a <b><i>working hypothesis to be verified</i></b>;
clearly, no interpretation of
results is possible in this case. GEMS is an instrument for making
thermodynamic data dance to your tune, but you are the composer
and the piper. No instrument plays itself or writes its own music.
GEMS is just a tool for checking how good your ideas are.</blockquote>
<big> GEMS cannot solve for processes in far-from-equilibrium or
transient systems. </big>
<blockquote>Some natural, biological or technological systems,
especially at short time scales, exist far from equilibrium or in a
transient state. In such cases, fundamental assumptions about local and
partial equilibria cannot be applied and, therefore, methods of
equilibrium chemical thermodynamic cannot be used. Think hard, before
doing any model calculations with GEMS or another speciation code,
whether the concept of local/partial equilibrium is adequate for your
system of interest; otherwise you may just spend time for nothing (and
this process is irreversible!).</blockquote>
<big> GEMS is not a tool for plotting phase diagrams.</big>
<blockquote>Plotting phase diagrams is a popular exercise in teaching
chemical thermodynamics in petrology or metallurgy, and in aquatic
chemistry as well. This requires very serious simplification of the
chemical system (to make it observable in 2D or 3D coordinate space),
often done using <i>ad hoc</i> &nbsp;assumptions. However, the GEM
modeling is aimed at quantifying&nbsp; effects of equilibration at
given (sequence of) T,P, and bulk composition in <b>full complexity</b>
of phases and species in the system, perhaps with many additional
kinetic, metastability and/or dispersity constraints. When phases,
species and reactions relevant for the particular system's behavior
will be identified from the GEMS output, many kinds of diagrams can be
plotted using conventional techniques, but now with much less
assumptions. In many cases, GEMS batch calculations can be designed in
a way that directly output phase or activity diagrams.</blockquote>
<big> GEMS cannot create thermodynamic data or assess their quality. </big>
<blockquote>Any chain is as strong as it's weekest link... Likewise, <b><i>any</i></b>
  <b><i>modeling result is not better than the input compositional and
thermodynamic data</i></b>. In the past 20 years, a considerable
progress has been made in compilation of internally consistent
thermodynamic databases, including that supplied as the default
database with GEMS code. However, no database covers everything, it is
usually necessary to extend it with the standard-state data for some
missing relevant species or minerals. GEMS provides a number of
advanced tools for extension of the project thermodynamic database, but
only you
can critically analyze the literature or your own experimental data,
and only you can evaluate quality of thus obtained standard-state
constants. GEMS cannot replace an expert in critical compilation,
matching and
retrieval of thermodynamic data, although it offers helpful many tools
for such experts.</blockquote>

<h3><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><a name="PRACTICAL_ISSUES"></a></font>Some
Practical Issues<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
</font></h3>
<p>In most geochemical modelling studies (except maybe simple test
examples) you will need to <i><b>extend thermodynamic database with
some new relevant species and phases</b></i>, or change some
thermodynamic properties in a consistent way. A <i><b>modelling
project concept</b></i> implemented in GEMS lets you performing such
data base extensions/modifications conveniently and continue modelling
runs right away: already created records with chemical equilibria will
be extended automatically.&nbsp; </p>
<p>All input data and results of GEM calculations are automatically
stored in the <i><b>modelling project data base</b></i> files and
nowhere else. You can easily zip your modelling project directory to
back-up your work or to share it with your colleagues. Anyone who has
GEMS installed on her/his PC can unpack your project and run it, as you
would continue running it on your PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>GEMS has a unique structure of thermodynamic database: the standard
state data for species are kept either in <b><i>thermochemical</i></b>
(optionally equation-of-state) format, or as <b><i>reactions defining
standard-state properties</i></b> of a given species via that of the
other species and the reaction. Data of both formats, when entered and
saved into database records, can be immediately used in calculations of
chemical equilibria. Before saving records, many data consistency
checks can be performed. </p>
<p>Unlike most other, command-driven or batch-input-file geochemical
modelling codes (e.g., PHREEQC, EQ3/6, GWB, ChemGeo, Selektor-C), GEMS
is an
<i><b>interactive modular package</b></i> in which computational
modules
share data objects in memory, manipulated by the data base maintenance
module.
GEMS is written in C/C++ and has a modern, window-based,
mouse-menu-driven GUI (graphical user's interface), based on the Qt3.x
GUI Toolkit. This toolkit also provides GEMS <i><b>with cross-platform
portability</b></i>: the source code of GEMS can be compiled and
executed on most Intel-based Linux/Unix and Windows
platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>In GEMS, <b><i>no batch files with input data are necessary</i></b>.
The program operation is fully interactive, controlled (as most modern
software) by mouse clicking on icons or menu items, selecting record
keys from lists, or entering data directly into spreadsheet-like screen
forms. Your entered or calculated data is automatically stored in the
project data base, where it is kept accessible for subsequent
calculations or data sampling, plotting or exporting. This <i><b>interactive
functionality</b></i> makes the geochemical modeling process more
efficient than it has ever been possible before. </p>
<p>Almost all kinds of data accesible in GEMS windows using the data
object
labels can be printed into ASCII text files using the simple <b><i>print
formatting scripts</i></b>. A collection of template printing scripts
is provided for the user' convenience; all scripts can easily be
customized
and saved into your project data base. </p>
<p>GEMS GUI provides you with three levels of a <b><i>context-sensitive
hypertext on-line help</i></b>. For&nbsp; experienced users, the
tooltips (popping up on almost every button or data field) are usually
sufficient. Direct access to all pages of the HTML documentation is
possible from any dialog, screen form, and even a single data field
cell on any screen form. If you have a fast internet connection (LAN,
ADSL, cable etc.) then you can set up GEMS to get help pages on-line
from the GEMS home site at LES PSI: in this way you can get the
last-updated documentation
before it will be included in the next release.&nbsp; </p>
<p>GEMS numerical kernel is an<b><i> Interior Points Method</i></b>
(IPM) module for non-linear minimization of total Gibbs energy of the
heterogeneous multi-phase chemical system (Karpov, Chudnenko and Kulik
1997, <i>Amer.J.Sci</i>. v.297, p.767-806). Since GEMS-PSI version
1.94a, this kernel comes optimized for the mass balance precision,
convergence, and extended input data diagnostics as an<i><b>
&nbsp;enhanced GEM IPM-2 module</b></i>&nbsp; to meet needs of the most
demanding modelling applications related to performance assessment in
nuclear waste disposal or in aquatic geochemistry. </p>
<p>The GEM IPM-2 numerical module is <b><i>fast and robust</i></b>,
and it can check internal consistency of the input data. There are
important classes of problems, such as redox equilibrium in solid
solution-aqueous solution systems, which are difficult to solve using
the commonly available speciation codes (such as PHREEQC) based on the
law-of-mass action
algorithm and reactions logK database. However, such problems are
easily and directly solved with the IPM - even in the systems including
several (non-ideal) multi-component solid solutions or multi-surface
sorption phases. </p>
<p>Of course, GEMS solves traditional equilibrium aqueous speciation
problems, perhaps, somewhat slower than the LMA code, but providing
even more output parameters at less input data. pH, Eh, ionic strength
and fugacities of gases are always obtained as&nbsp; <b><i>output</i></b>
(not input) parameters in GEM calculations. This helps greatly in
investigating behaviour of redox-dependent systems. </p>
