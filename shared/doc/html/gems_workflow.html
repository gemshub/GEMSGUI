Database</h3>
<p><br>
What to do if you have reached a conclusion that an aqueous complex or
solid phase are missing in the system profile you worked with? Or you
do
not like some thermodynamic data in the GEM-Selektor kernel database
and
want to replace them? These situations are very typical in geochemical
modelling
and may sometimes need a lot of effort to be resolved. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>In GEM-Selektor, it is easy to do thermodynamic database extensions
and make them available to your system profile, although this requires
some
understanding on how the thermodynamic database is organized and
maintained.
You may skip the following five paragraphs if you are already familiar
with
GEMS thermodynamic data framework. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote><a name="TDB_OVERVIEW"></a>The GEM-Selektor thermodynamic
database has four levels of data, kept in the IComp, DComp, ReacDC, and
Phase record types (chains). The <a href="gm_icomp.html">IComp</a>
chain contains records defining Independent Components (IC), or
stoichiometry units, which form a common stoichiometry basis for
expressing&nbsp; composition of chemical systems and species. The IComp
symbols (mainly chemical elements and charge), and only them, can be
used in writing&nbsp; <a href="g_useref.html#FORMULA">chemical formulae</a>&nbsp;
of&nbsp; thermodynamic&nbsp; species, or Dependent Components (DC),
which are stored in&nbsp; <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a>&nbsp;
or&nbsp; <a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a>&nbsp; database records.
DC formulae are automatically processed for calculation of the species
molar mass, formula charge, checking consistency of thermodynamic data,
and producing stoichiometry matrices for calculation of chemical
equilibria. In addition, IComp records contain default valence numbers
of elements to simplify chemical formulae, as well as values of
absolute entropy of elements, needed for conversions between standard
molar Gibbs energy, enthalpy and entropy of chemical species. <br>
&nbsp;
  <p>DComp records keep the formulae and standard state thermodynamic
properties of solid, gas, liquid and aqueous species (DC) in
"thermochemical" format. Namely, it includes the standard molar
properties (or standard partial molal properties) at reference pressure
and temperature: Gibbs energy <i>G<sup>o</sup></i>&nbsp; and enthalpy <i>H<sup>o</sup>&nbsp;</i>
of formation from IC (chemical elements) at standard states, absolute
entropy <i>S<sup>o</sup>&nbsp;</i> and molar volume <i>V<sup>o</sup></i>
. Optionally, the <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a> records may
contain vectors of empirical <i>Cp<sup>o</sup> </i>= <i>f </i>(<i>T
  </i>), <i>V<sup>o</sup> </i>= <i>f </i>(<i>T,P</i> ), equation
-of - state coefficients etc., necessary for <a href="theortdb.html">calculation
of
standard thermodynamic properties at elevated pressures and temperatures</a>.
All the numbers contained in DComp records refer to the stoichiometry
of
this particular species, rather than to its reaction with other
species.
In other words, data in different DComp records are connected only
through
IC stoichiometries of species and information kept in IComp records. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <p><a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a> records are used for defining
thermodynamic properties of aqueous and surface complexes and minerals
for which thermochemical data are not available or too uncertain. For
such species, only log<i>K</i>&nbsp; of the dissolution, association or
surface complexation reaction is usually known (often predicted at 25 <sup>o</sup>C
or other temperatures). Thus, a ReacDC record describes the reaction
and its properties (and also <i>T,P</i>&nbsp; dependence of&nbsp; log<i>K</i>
). Because GEM algorithms cannot use reactions and stability constants
directly for calculation of equilibria, ReacDC record also provides a
full set of standard (partial molal) thermodynamic properties for a
"new" species, computed from the properties of the reaction and that of
all other species involved in the reaction. The "new", reaction-defined
compound, actually, gives a name to the reaction and to the ReacDC <a
 href="gemstdbm.html#P3324">record key</a>. Thermodynamic properties of
this
compound
are automatically maintained consistent (to that of other species
involved
into the reaction) at all temperatures and pressures. The "involved"
species
must already exist in the database as either <a
 href="gemstdbm.html#P33D3">DComp</a>
or
other ReacDC records: a given ReacDC definition can refer to other
ReacDC
records (but not to itself), thus forming a "reaction chain" (up to
seven
levels of recursion are supported). Any reaction chain always
terminates
with a reaction which refers to DComp records only. Several&nbsp; <a
 href="theortdb.html">methods of calculation</a> of thermodynamic
properties of reaction-defined species at elevated&nbsp; <i>T,P&nbsp; </i>are
available in GEM-Selektor. ReacDC module is a unique feature of GEMS,
to our knowledge, not yet available in full elsewhere. Accordingly, the
GEM-Selektor database is the first in a sense that thermochemical data
and reactions are used
together for any kind of geochemical modelling and data consistency is
automatically maintained. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <p><a href="gm_phase.html">Phase</a> definition records put together
links to input data from both DComp and ReacDC record types. Design of
GEM-Selektor requires that each (even a single- component) phase to be
taken into calculation of equilibrium states must be&nbsp; described in
a separate <a href="gm_phase.html">Phase</a> record, with (unique)
phase name appearing in the <a href="gemstdbm.html#P3326">Phase record
key</a>. <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a> or <a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a>
definitions do not contain all information for defining structure and
behavior of the single- or multi-component phases. In fact, any data
describing the non-ideal mixing behavior of end-members is valid for a
particular model of phase only, and alternative representations are
often possible. The flexible Phase data structure permits formulation
of a large variety of crystalline and dispersed, liquid and gaseous,
adsorption and ion-exchange ideal or non-ideal phases which may occur
in different
(geo)chemical systems. Please, note that <a href="gm_profil.html">System
Profiles</a> in GEMS are constructed from Phase definitions, i.e. the
profile
cannot "see" any DComp or ReacDC records which are not referred to by
at
least one Phase record accessible to the profile. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <p>What does it mean "accessible"? In GEM-Selektor, every database
chain consists of several files, usually located in two places: a
"kernel database" and a "user's profile" directories. The
write-protected "kernel database" directory contains IComp, DComp,
ReacDC and Phase database files with more or less "standard"
thermodynamic data for major and many minor chemical elements;
is supplied and installed together with GEMS program and help files.
The
user's profile directory is automatically created when the user creates
a
new system profile for his/her modelling applications; this is the only
place
where all the input data provided by the user and calculation results
can
be stored. Any time, the database file can be linked in or out of the
current
database configuration of GEM-Selektor. When a file is linked in, all
the
records it contains become "visible" for the user and the program in
record
key lists. Accordingly, these records become "invisible" and
inaccessible after the file has been linked out. New database files can
be any time created by the user in his profile directory and linked in,
if necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the GEM-Selektor kernel thermodynamic database can be used
for solving many various geochemical problems (see <a
 href="g_tutor.html">Tutorial</a>), almost every study involving
thermodynamic modeling, sooner or later, faces a problem of
inconsistency or incompleteness of thermodynamic data. It is therefore
necessary to have convenient tools to handle the data, check and match
them, and incorporate into equilibria calculations. The tradition,
however, is such that most of modeling codes contain files with
thermodynamic data from published databases but still no tools to work
with the data (except using them for speciation calculations). <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>There are some specialized codes such as SUPCRT92 [<a
 href="g_litref.html#%5B1992JOH/OEL%5D">1992JOH/OEL</a>] which handle
the thermodynamic database, calculate user-specified reactions, plot
them on
diagrams, but they cannot calculate equilibria in multi-component
systems.
Moreover, most of speciation programs based on the Law of Mass Action
(LMA)
algorithm (like PHREEQC2 [<a href="g_litref.html#%5B1999PAR/APP%5D">1999PAR/APP</a>]
or MINTEQA2 [1991ALL/BRO] use thermodynamic data exclusively in the
form of reaction equilibrium constants <i>K</i>&nbsp; for the
"product" species plus dependences of <i>K</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; on
temperature and/or pressure. Thermochemical
data must be recalculated first into log<i>K</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; values
(e.g.,
as in EQ3/6&nbsp; [1992WOL]) to be used in such codes. There are,
however,
special utility programs PMATCH [1989PEA/AVI] and PM2SEL [1999DMY/KUL]
which
can help in checking the internal consistency of&nbsp; thermodynamic
data
and convert it into different formats. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>Programs based on GEM algorithms (e.g., ChemGeo, GIBBS,
GEM-Selektor), on the contrary, accept only the standard partial
molar(molal) values of Gibbs energy for all species <i>g<sup>o </sup></i>(<i>T,P&nbsp;
</i>), so any data represented as log<i>K</i> (<i>T,P&nbsp; </i>) must
first be converted to <i>g<sup>o </sup></i>(<i>T,P&nbsp; </i>)
values before usage in GEM modeling calculations. In this case, it is
not easy to extend thermodynamic database with consistent data for some
new components if their thermochemical properties are not known. Hence,
the structure of GEM-Selektor database has been designed to help in
overcoming these difficulties. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>Example? Diagram?</blockquote>
<p>When you press the "<tt>Thermodynamic Database</tt>" button on
GEM-Selektor Main dialog, you will see a "Thermodynamic Database"
dialog window with six
large buttons for accessing the <a href="gm_icomp.html">IComp</a>, <a
 href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a>, <a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a>, <a
 href="gm_rtparm.html">RTparm</a>, <a href="gm_compos.html">Phase</a>
and <a href="gm_compos.html">Compos</a> module windows, described in
the corresponding manuals. The respective six database chains contain
records with all the
input data necessary for building GEM chemical models, linked together
into
the System Profile ("Default" in this exercise). Part of database files
in
each chain belongs to the kernel database which you can use but not
modify;
another part belongs to your own "Default" profile directory; all
extensions
and changes you make can be stored there and only there. In other
words,
the kernel database will remain unaffected by your personal
modifications
of thermodynamic data, and your own work will retain compatibility with
system profiles created by other GEMS users. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h4> <a name="3_3_1_override_data"></a>3.3.1 Overriding data in kernel
database</h4>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>A typical case (especially for experienced modellers) is when the
user refuses&nbsp; thermodynamic data for some species or minerals
provided in the kernel database, but the corresponding records cannot
be changed because they are write-protected. Of course, you could
create a new DComp or ReacDC records with different names for those
species and type in your favorite
numbers; after the system profile is open next time, you should not
forget
to switch off the "primarily provided" species from the SysEq selection
lists.
But GEM- Selektor offers&nbsp; a far more elegant way - <i>an override
mechanism of record selection, </i>which applies to lists of record
keys in ReacDC, Phase, and Profile/SysEq data structures only. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>In the GEMS database, structurized <a href="gdb_rkey.html">record
key formats</a> are supported.&nbsp; For instance, <a
 href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a> and <a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a>
record key formats are identical and include four fields - phase state,
group,
species name, and comment (data set code). The primary idea of these
formats
was to keep long lists of DC record keys in a well-structurized way as
the
database chain index is alphabetically sorted, so that aqueous species
are
first, gases next, and minerals at the end. Within aqueous species
list,
the group name (second field) usually refers to metal cation or ligand,
so
all complexes of a given metal are conveniently held together in the
lists.
Actually, the species name is the most important because it may appear
in
the (case sensitive) <a href="gmscript.html">math scripts.</a>&nbsp;
The
fourth field serves to indicate the original data set from where the
data
were taken and (optionally) grade of their uncertainty.</blockquote>
<p><a name="OVERRIDE"></a>The <b><i>override mechanism</i></b>&nbsp;
consists in that the last field of the record key is actually ignored
when the records are loaded during processing of the lists of record
keys in&nbsp; ReacDC, Phase and Profile/SysEq data structures. So, when
the program finds more than one&nbsp; record with the same record key
fields except the last one,&nbsp; it simply takes in a record keyed
alphabetically the first and ignores others; no warnings are issued. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>Let us check how the override mechanism works using a celestite (SrSO<sub>4</sub>)
example. From the "Thermodynamic Database" dialog, press the <tt>"Dependent
Components (DComp)" </tt>button. In appearing "DComp" window, click on
the "Show" icon (first from the left) and in the list, select the line <tt>s:SrSO:celestite:rs:</tt>&nbsp;
and press <tt>"Ok"</tt>. You will see the DComp record for celestite
from GEMS kernel database which contains data from the USGS dataset [<a
 href="g_litref.html#%5B1995ROB/HEM%5D">1995ROB/HEM</a>]&nbsp;
(indicated by&nbsp; <tt>rs</tt>&nbsp; in the last record key field).
The drawback of this data is absence of <i>Cp<sup>o</sup></i> = <i>f </i>(<i>T
</i>) coefficients and heat capacity value at 25 <sup>o</sup>C (check
on <tt>Page 2</tt> of
"DComp" window), thus making temperature extrapolation impossible.
Fortunately,
data for celestite is also available from the SUPCRT92 database [<a
 href="g_litref.html#%5B1992JOH/OEL%5D">1992JOH/OEL</a>] with
Majer-Kelly coefficients valid up to 1500 K (both data are compared
below in J/mol): <br>

&nbsp; </p>
<p>The SUPCRT92 data for celestite originate from a compilation by
H.Helgeson and others [1978HEL/DEL]; it allows for temperature
extrapolation and provides ca. 0.2 p<i>K</i> unit lower solubility of
celestite at 25 <sup>o</sup>C, compared to the data from [<a
 href="g_litref.html#%5B1995ROB/HEM%5D">1995ROB/HEM</a>], as seen from
the difference in values of&nbsp; <i>G<sup>o</sup><sub>298</sub></i> .
<br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>To use SUPCRT92 data for celestite in equilibria calculations,
select <tt>"Record" "Save As"</tt> menu commands in order to create a
new <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a> record with identical first
three key fields and an alphabetically higher fourth field. A small
dialog entitled "DComp: Insert new record keyed" appears, with
the&nbsp; <tt>s:SrSO:celestite:rs3: </tt>record key disassembled into
four editor lines. Change only the last (fourth) line from&nbsp; <tt>"rs3"</tt>
to <tt>"h78"</tt> (or any other
alphabetically preceding value) and press <tt>"Ok"</tt>.&nbsp; You
will
see a selection list entitled "Choose database file to put a record..."
with
DComp database file names, currently linked to GEMS. Select a&nbsp; <tt>dcomp.Default
</tt>file (other files belong to the kernel database and are
write-protected)
and press <tt>"Ok"</tt>. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now, the DComp window appears again with previous contents, but
under different
record key. Enter data from the above table (right column) into <tt>Page
1</tt> there (heat capacity coefficients and their validity temperature
interval
into <tt>Page 2</tt>). Change reference in dSDref field on <tt>Page 1</tt>
to <tt>"Helgeson_ea:1978:pap:".</tt> Press <tt>"Calculate"</tt> icon
(or
<tt>F9</tt>). A small dialog with a question "Calculate standard values
..."
appears; press<tt> "Yes"</tt> - this will check consistency of standard
properties
and calculate <i>Cp<sup>o</sup><sub>298</sub></i> value for celestite
from
the Majer-Kelly coefficients that you entered on <tt>Page 2</tt>. If
this
value is not 107.83 then the <i>Cp<sup>o</sup></i> = <i>f </i>(<i>T </i>)
coefficients were not entered correctly; if so then check numbers
entered on <tt>Page 2</tt> and&nbsp; repeat calculation. Press <tt>"Save"</tt>
icon when finished. You can also perform data restoration and
consistency checks; for instance, put "Empty" value (`) into the <tt>H0d[0]</tt>
cell and press <tt>"Calculate"</tt> button. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>Upon the next calculation, any reference to celestite in ReacDC,
Phase records and Profile/SysEq structures will operate with your new
data for celestite, without any furtner reconfiguration. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>A little bit more complicated change is needed when you wish to
replace <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a> data for a mineral but you
have only reaction logK and can create <a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a>
record only. This requires to override <a href="gm_phase.html">Phase</a>
definition which
refers to this species: just copy it (using a "Record" "Save as" menu
command)
with alphabetically higher last record key field into your <tt>phase.&lt;profilename&gt;.pdb</tt>
file (). Then remake new phase definition so that it would point to
your
own ReacDC record. Done! <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h4> <a name="3_3_2_insert_new"></a>3.3.2 Inserting new species and
phases</h4>
<p><br>
Second typical (and not so rare) case is that, after some modeling
sessions, you have reached a conclusion that a mineral and/or an
aqueous complex,&nbsp; which in reality most probably define measured
metal concentrations, are
missing from your modeling system. There is nothing unusual - no
thermodynamic database is complete, not even the GEM-Selektor kernel
database. It is more
important to have effiicient tools for extending your database and
system
formulations. Such tools are at your disposal! <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>The simplest case is adding aqueous or gaseous species if your <a
 href="gm_profil.html">system profile</a> uses default (automatically
assembled during opening of the profile) aqueous and gas phases. All
you have to do is to collect thermodynamic data and create missing <a
 href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a> and/or <a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a>
records in database extension files in your profile directory. We
recommend keeping up with the style of record keys used in the kernel
database. These new species will be taken into all your SysEq
definitions when you select the "Computation of Equilibria" mode and
open your profile next time (press "Ok" on warnings about detection of
your newly inserted species). <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>Please, do not forget to re-calculate all equilibria already stored
in SysEq records in your profile! The program automatically updates
indexation in <a href="gm_syseq.html">SysEq</a> records after some
species were excluded or added from/to the system profile, but it
cannot decide in which cases these species can affect modelling
results, so this is left to your discretion. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you wish to add mineral phases to your system, first check
whether the
respective DComp records are available in the kernel database - Phase
definitions
are provided there only for the most commonly used minerals. If this is
the
case, simply create missing <a href="gm_phase.html">Phase definition</a>
records. If not - then create <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a> or <a
 href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a> record, enter thermodynamic data, and
save
the record in one of the database extension files in your profile
directory
(best is to load some of the existing records and use them as templates
by
applying "Record" "Save As" menu command). Then&nbsp; create a new
Phase record (single- or multi-component phases) and remake it to point
to the
new DC record. New phases and components will be automatically inserted
into
System Profile lists upon the next opening of the profile. Do not
forget
to recalculate those <a href="gm_syseq.html">SysEq</a> records (system
definitions)
in which you deem the new phases to be stable! <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>One important remark about non-aqueous and non-gaseous phases and
their components: the system profile is assembled by picking up all
records available in the current Phase database chain (with due regard
to the override mechanism). Only those <a href="gm_dcomp.html">DComp</a>
and <a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a> records will be selected that
are referred to in <a href="gm_phase.html">Phase</a> records. This
means that some species or minerals in your database extension may not
be used in equilibria calculations if you (on purpose or by chance) did
not include them into Phase record
lists. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>Creating definitions of single component condensed phases is by far
the simplest task because such a definition does not include any math
script equations and refers only to one species (the system profile <a
 href="gemstdbm.html#OVERRIDE">override mechanism</a> applies for
loading
DComp/ReacDC data referred to in <a href="gm_phase.html">Phase
definitions</a>). In a Remake
configuration window which comes after you have specified the new <a
 href="gdb_rkey.html#dbm_Phase">Phase record key</a>, check that <tt>"NNNNNN"</tt>
is entered into<tt> p_solt</tt>&nbsp; fields with <a
 href="g_useref.html#NONIDTYPES">codes for non-ideality phase types;</a>&nbsp;
either of <tt>"l", "s"</tt> or <tt>"d"</tt> code stays in the <tt>Ph_Ps[0,0]</tt><a
 href="g_useref.html#PHASETYPES">phase class field</a>, and press "Ok".
Then select one species from DComp or ReacDC record lists that appear
later.
Type in the phase name and check that <tt>"O"</tt> (single component)
code
is present in the <tt>PhDCC</tt> (species class) field. Finally, save
the
new phase definition record into one of your profile extension database
files. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h4> <a name="3_3_3_check_trends"></a>3.3.3 Checking T,P trends for
new species</h4>
<p><br>
When thermodynamic data are entered into <a href="gm_dcomp.html">Dcomp</a>
records, or new <a href="gm_reacdc.html">ReacDC</a> definitions are
constructed, misprints and errors can be introduced. Some of them are
automatically detected by Dcomp and ReacDC modules, i.e. such errors
incomplete or inconsistent standard state data, wrong formula
stoichiometry, incorrect charge; the corresponding diagnostic messages
are then issued. Some other errors can be detected only when a series
of thermodynamic data for varying <i>T,P</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; is computed
and plotted on graphs. Thus, the RTparm module and window screen forms
are provided for facilitating the process of "debugging"&nbsp;
thermodynamic data and their <i>T,P</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; dependencies for
individual species. <a href="gm_rtparm.html">RTparm</a> module takes
input data from Dcomp or ReacDC record with the four first fields same
as in the <a href="gdb_rkey.html#dbm_RTParm">RTparm record key</a>.
The <a href="gemstdbm.html#OVERRIDE">override mechanism</a> does not
apply to
RTparm lists in order to make it possible to compare different
representation of temperature-pressure trends for one species. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>Several RTPARM records can be created for one DCOMP or REACDC
record, and
up to four such records can be plotted together on graphs, e.g., for
comparison
of different temperature extrapolations. The RTPARM function, taken
together
with flexibility of DCOMP and REACDC definitions implemented in GEMS,
provides
a new level of matching and user's extension of thermodynamic database,
and
can save a lot of time and effort in putting together various data
needed
for modeling systems of environmental geochemical interest. Since the
same
DCthermo() and RCthermo() routines are used in both RTPARM and <a
 href="gemstdbm.html#P3250">System Profile</a> calculations, the tests
done by
RTPARM
will make you confident that nothing unexpected can happen with
thermodynamic
data during calculation of equilibria at non-ambient temperatures and
pressures. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>As usual, new RTPARM calculations are performed in GEMS by creating
new records. In a Remake configuration window (invoked by <a
 href="gemstdbm.html#P333R2">Remake</a> or <a
 href="gemstdbm.html#P333R3">Create</a> commands),
the user can specify how many points for temperature and pressure will
be calculated, which thermodynamic data collected and how they will be
displayed on four plots. This is done using flags and switches
(equipped with help messages popping up at mouse pointer, as usual).
After pressing OK, the RTPARM screen form appears again, there minimum,
maximum temperature-pressure and their increments can be specified if
different from default (0 to 375 <sup>o</sup>C in 15 <sup>o</sup>C
increments at P<sub>SAT</sub>). <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>Calculations are performed&nbsp; with <a href="gemstdbm.html#P333R4">Calculate</a>
command;
when finished, up to four graphs are displayed on <tt>"Record" "<a
 href="gemstdbm.html#P333R8">Plot</a>"</tt> menu command and can be <a
 href="gemstdbm.html#P3290">customized</a>
as in <a href="gemstdbm.html#P3280">GTDEMO</a> record. The calculated
data can also
be printed into a text file using a <tt>"Record" "<a
 href="gemstdbm.html#P333R9">Print</a>"
</tt>command. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h4> <a name="3_3_4_create_PCO"></a>3.3.4 Creating Predefined
Composition Object (PCO) definitions</h4>
<p><br>
A useful extension of your modeling tollbox is creating GCO definitions
(<a href="gemstdbm.html#P33D2">Compos</a> records) and storing them in
your <tt>/compos.&lt;pname&gt;.pdb</tt>
file. It helps much in setting bulk compositions of systems in a neat
and transparent way, especially for simulation of such processes as
mixing , evaporation, weathering etc. As usual in GEMS, the easiest way
is to "clone" existing Compos records with <a
 href="gemstdbm.html#P333R3">Create</a>
or <a href="gemstdbm.html#P333R6">Save As</a> menu commands, remaking
and
re-calculating them whenever appropriate. The new Compos record keys
will be automatically added to the <a href="gemstdbm.html#P3400">System
Profile</a>
when you open it next time. </p>
<p>Let us consider an example of creating a new Compos record for the
kaolinite stoichiometry. First, press "Show" button to get the
record&nbsp; "<tt>Kaolinite:MIN:Al2Si2O5(OH)4:</tt>". You will
see&nbsp; a very simple screen where composition of kaolinite is
expressed in moles of chemical elements in the "CI" vector. The
MasVol[0] cell shows kaolinite molar mass in kg, and MasVol[6] displays
the total number
of moles of elements per mole of kaolinite. </p>
<p>Try to express the same composition in mole percents of petrogenic
oxides Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O.
First, execute&nbsp;
"Record" "<a href="gemstdbm.html#P333R3">Create</a>" command, modify
the previous
record
key as follows: "<tt>Kaolinite1:MIN:Moles_oxides:</tt>" and press OK.
In
appearing "Reorganization of data fields" dialog, press "<tt>Remake</tt>"
button. In the next "Compos: Remake parameters" dialog, turn first
switch off and third switch on. In counters to the right, put zero into
fist one and 3 (number of required formulae for petrogenic oxides) into
third counter, and press <tt>OK</tt>. In c_icbc selection list which
appears next, check "Clear All" and then "Proceed" buttons. </p>
<p>Now, the "Compos::" screen form appears, with empty&nbsp; list of
formulae "formU". Type SiO2 into its first line; Al2O3 into second and
H2O into third line. Now,&nbsp; specify composition of kaolinite in
"CA" vector (to the
right) by entering 2 against SiO2 formula, 1 against Al2O3 and 2
against
H2O. These numbers will be interpreted depending on <a
 href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6104">units of measurement</a> coded in
the&nbsp; "AUcl" vector (in between), and then will be converted to
numbers of moles and added to bulk GCO composition. By default, 'M'
letters (numbers of moles) appear in AUcl. Be careful with MasVol[0]
and MasVol[6] cells because they are used for normalizing the
composition you have specified to certain mass or total number of IC
moles, respectively. MasVol[0] contains total mass
of geochemical object Ms in kg.&nbsp; If 0 or EMPTY value ` were
specified
by the user then mass fractions can not be used and Ms will be
automatically calculated from moles or molar (molal) concentrations. A
positive value
should be entered in MasVol[0] cell if at least one value in CI, CD or
CA
vectors is specified as mass percent&nbsp; '%'&nbsp; in classifiers
CIcl,
CDcl or CAcl. In our kaolinite example, type zero into MasVol[6] and
0.1
into MasVol[0] cells.&nbsp; Now, press "Calculate"&nbsp; to calculate
100
g of kaolinite stoichiometry (you will see new&nbsp; numbers in the
leftmost
"Cm" vector), and "Save" to save the new record to database (do not
forget
to delete this exercise before you open the System Profile next time). </p>
<p>&nbsp;It is important that each element of CI, CD or CA vectors (and
their equivalents in SysEq dialog) can be set up in different <a
 href="GEMS-Linux-USREF.html#P6104">units of measurement</a>. This is
very convenient and gives the user an unprecedented freedom in working
with bulk compositions or modifying them. When specifying different
units, one should take care of their base quantities. For example, when
setting molality units, a mass of water-solvent should always be set.
Read carefully all the help lines to MasVol cells for instructions how
to set base quantities and units of measurement correctly. Examination
of available Compos records and some experimentation will give you the
right feeling how&nbsp; to work with GCO records. Negative numbers can
be used in CI, CD and CA vectors as long as they do not produce
negative numbers of moles in the total GCO composition "Cm" vector. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h4> <a name="3_3_5_update_profile"></a>3.3.5 Updating the System
Profile</h4>
<p><br>
This is done automatically when the user enters "Computation of
Equilibria" mode of GEM-Selektor and selects a system profile from the
appearing list. If some records in thermodynamic database have been
created or deleted,
a warning appears in each case. Press "Ok" to confirm changes or
"Cancel"
if the record was inserted or deleted by mistake (in the latter case,
you
will need to fix the problem before attempting to open your system
profile
again). After insertion of some phases and species into the profile, it
is usually necessary to re-calculate at least part of <a
 href="gm_syseq.html">SysEq</a> records produced before (and maybe,
also
some <a href="gm_proces.html">Process</a>&nbsp; and <a
 href="gm_gtdemo.html">GtDemo</a> definitions). <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>The usual case for removing some phases from the profile (i.e.
respective Phase records from thermodynamic database) is that, after
all the necessary models have been calculated, it happens that these
phases never appeared in equilibria. Cleaning such phases out helps in
keeping your profile lists smaller and easier to look through. In this
situation, it is not necessary to re-calculate all the SysEq records
because nothing is going to change. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h4> <a name="3_3_6_rerun_syseq"></a>3.3.6 Re-running already
calculated
equilibria</h4>
<p><br>
There are two ways for re-calculating <a href="gm_syseq.html">SysEq</a>
records: (i) one-by-one (from the "Single Thermodynamic System" dialog)
and (ii) batch calculations (re-calculation of <a href="gm_proces.html">Process</a>
definitions, preferable). <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>The one-by-one method is the only possible for the SysEq records
which are "standalone" or used as "parent" systems for Process
definitions. It consists of two steps: (1) Press "Load..." button and
select the record; (2)
Press "BCC" and then "IPM" buttons to re-run GEM IPM module. "Accept"
on
the IPM Progress dialog will also save updated SysEq record to
database. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>The batch calculation requires first to open the "Process" window,
then load the necessary Process record, and press "Calculate" icon or
menu item to recalculate all SysEq records created by this Process
definition. Re-calculating all GtDemo definitions related to this
process is also advisable for re-plotting results and looking what
changed. <br>

"clone" and change definitions of chemical systems in the GEM-Selektor
profile and immediately see what happens to the equilibrium states.
Later on, you can work through the Tutorial to gain a lot more
experience. It is really easy to check various (geo)chemical ideas
using GEM-Selektor! <br>
