<h4>
Technical data and specifications<br>
</h4>

Known to be compiled and work on RedHat Linux 6.1/Intel, FreeBSD
3.3/Intel,
Solaris 7 on Intel and Sparc
<br>

The work is being done to complete Win32 version - excpeted to end
in Febrary 2000.
<p>GEMS is compiled using EGCS-1.1.2 (or with GCC-2.95.2 with some
patches)
for Unix platforms and Borland C++ 5.4 compiler (C++ Builder 4) for
Win32
(need some patches).
<br>
For Unices all one have to do is modify Makefile.common to correct
paths to QT include and libs, and probably set compiler and linker
names.
For BorlandC++/Win32 special set of makefiles used as 'make' here
differs
a lot.
</p>

<p>GEMS sources are about 45000 line of code written in C++.
<br>
GUI&nbsp;part depends on QT library from Troll Tech (www.troll.no);
GEMS core depends on <b>string</b> and <b>auto_ptr </b>class from
C++&nbsp;STL
library and uses templates.
</p>

<p>GEMS occupies about 7MB of RAM
<br>
With initial database GEMS requiers about 7MB on hard drive
<br>
Pentium 133 or better should be fine for Intels.
<br>
We hope you have at least 256 color in your X Window System. :-)
</p>

<p>GEMS RPM installs gems executable in /usr/bin and support and DB
files
in /usr/lib/gems.
