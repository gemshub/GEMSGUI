Description of the IPM-DAT file format and example of the input IPM-DAT file

# GEMIPM2K v. 0.98
# Prototype 12.12.2006
# Comment lines are marked with '#' and will be ignored when reading the file

# ipm-dat text input file for GEM-IPM specific data generated by the 
# GEMS-PSI GEM2MT module 
# This file should be be read after the DATACH file and before the DATABR file

# The IPM-DAT file is complementary to the DATACH file. 
# The IPM-DAT file contains parts of chemical system definitions (CSD) that are 
# used by GEM IPM part but not visible to the FMT part of the coupled code. 
# Contents of this file will be placed in the MULTI internal work structure 
# of GEM IPM, not visible outside of it. 

# The IPM-DAT text input file consists of six sections, of which 
# sections (1) and (2) contains flags and dimensionalities for additional
# memory allocation for surface complexes (main dimensionalities of the 
# chemical system are given in DATACH file);
# section (3) contains numerical controls of GEM IPM algorithm operation
# and convergence;  
# section (4) defines the presence and data for mixing models of multi-
# component phases and, if necessary, the arrays of non-ideality parameters; 
# sections (5) and (6) provide some complete data arrays that may be 
# incomplete in DATABR file(s); 
# section (7) contains some initial data for phases; and, finally, 
# section (8) contains initial data for sorption (surface complexation) 
# phases, present if set in section (2). 

# In this version, there is a fixed order of data fields, each beginning 
# with a tag - a data name in <>. This may be changed to the arbitrary 
# order in the forthcoming versions. 

# The actual numbers in this description are related to a particular example 
# of the chemical system and are given for illustration purposes. 
# The numbers and name lists may change if a different CSD is constructed. 

# ID key of the initial chemical system definition 
"CalDolCol G  CalcColumn  1001 0       1       25      000 "

## (Section 1) Important flags that affect memory allocation
# Flag for using electroneutrality condition in GEM IPM calculations 
# (should be set to 1 if IC "charge" "Zz" is present in the system 
# definition; may be automatically switched off to 0 if e.g. aqueous 
# phase has been eliminated)
<pa_PE>            1

# Flag for the volume balance constraint (on Vol IC) - for indifferent
# equilibria at P_Sat (not used in this version). If PV = 1 then the 
# Independent Component "Vol" must be included for volume balance. The 
# normal value of PV is 0.
<PV>               0

# Total number of DCs in liquid hydrocarbon phases (for the old FGL module, 
# will soon be obsolete).
<PSOL>             0

# The following two flags must be set on (+) if sorption phases are 
# present in the system definition
# Flag for using (+) or ignoring (-) specific surface areas of phases 
<PAalp>          '+'

# Flag for using (+) or ignoring (-) specific surface free energies of 
# phase-aqueous and phase-gas interfaces 
<PSigm>          '+'

## Section (2) Important additional dimensionalities that affect memory 
# allocation in the MULTI data structure of IPM
# Total number of Dependent Components in sorption phases included into
# this system. If Lads > 0 and FIa > 0 then the data section (7) must 
# be provided at the end of this file (see also "scm-ipm-dat-doc.txt" file)
<Lads>             0
# Number of sorption phases included in this system (0 if no sorption 
# phases are included).
<FIa>              0
# Actual maximum number of surface types per adsorption phase (if FIa > 0,
# <FIat> must be set to 6). 
<FIat>             0

## Section (3): Controls of operation of the GEM IPM numerical algorithm
# These settings should be changed carefully, only if you know what you 
# are doing. Wrong control values and flags may strongly hinder convergence, 
# accuracy and performance of GEM IPM, or cause it to crash or produce 
# meaningless results.

# charge "Zz"), moles (may be set in the interval 1e-17 < DB < 1e-7)

## (Section 4) Initial data for multicomponent phases (see DATACH file for 
# the dimension <nPS>) and mixing model parameters. 
# Codes for mixing models of multicomponent phases: six characters per
# phase, only built-in mixing models are allowed (no phase scripts). 
# Of these six characters, the second, third and fifth must be set to
# 'N'. The fourth character can be either 'I' (ideal mixing) or 'S' 
# (the built-in subroutine will be used for the non-ideal model). The 
# sixth character is either 'N' or the code of most complex EDL model 
# used in sorption phases. 
# The first character can be 'I' (ideal solution) or another character 
# which defines the built-in subroutine for calculation of activity 
# coefficients on GEM IPM iterations to be used for this phase).
# Some possible built-in subroutine codes:  
# 'G' - binary Guggenheim (Redlich-Kister) subregular solid solution;

#    parameters; requires <LsMod>[k] = 12 and 4 x 3 parameters (Wu, Ws, Wv) 
#    to be provided in the <PMc> array for this phase;
# 'H' - Extended Debye-Hueckel equation for aqueous species with common 
#    ion-size parameter a0 (Angstrom) and common b_gamma parameter; 
#    requires <LsMod>[0] = 8; the parameters are given in <PMc>[5] (a0) 
#    and <PMc>[6] (b_gamma), respectively (<PMc> indexation starts 
#    from [0]);

#    (Kielland) ion-size parameter a0 (Angstrom), taken from <DMc> vector
#    (<LsMdc>[0] = 1), and common b_gamma parameter given in <PMc>[6] (<PMc> 
#    indexation starts from [0], requires <LsMod>[0] = 8);
# '2' - Debye-Hueckel equation for aqueous species with individual  
#    (Kielland) ion-size parameter a0 (Angstrom), taken from <DMc> vector
