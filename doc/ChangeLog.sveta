  scripts, improved on plotting functionality. The record
  format was been changed.
  Done:
  One graphdialog is sufficient, with a possibility to
  plot also experimental data (for fitting).
  Major re-arrangement is needed for the RTparm module and record
  structure: (a) convert "float" to "double" for calculated vectors,
  add TK vector for temperature in Kelvins and vectors for the empi-
  rical T,P data; (b) introduce MATH SCRIPT for supporting calculations,
  similar to GTDemo module, make DCthermo() and RCthermo() applicable
  to a given TP pair via the calls;
  (c) add into record the information for setup of graphs (four of them,
  or for one graph similar to GTdemo record), don't forget saving the
  background color; (d) write a "print" slot for printing-exporting
  the tabulated data to text files (again similar to GTdemo);

      - void CopyF( const char * fName, const char* fTempl );
        copy data from file fTempl to file fName
      - void makeDBDir(const char *dir);
        make new data base directori

23/07/2001

      "GEM-Selektor v1.93b-PSI: Controls&defaults for numeric modules",
  in Linux version was Error massage about limited size.

06/07/2001
      Fixed a bug:
   On re-opening profile after updating definitions of single-
   component phases in database, the warning contains correct
   phase key but wrong DComp key (the action itself is correct)
   Error cheking dcomp keys in single-component phases.

06/07/2001
      Fixed a bug:
         After starting gems -d ... and exiting with
           "Save configuration", next start in usual mode
           gems -s -u works OK. But, if one opens any profile
           and then exits gems with "Save configuration", upon
           the next usual start, it crashes (EAccess) on pressing
           "Calculation of Equilibria" button. Debugger shows that
           stack is corrupt before the program really gets into
           the "Open Profile mode".

19/06/2001
   In function of File selection (vfChooseFileSave)
   change current directory to userGEMDir directory

19/06/2001
    Implement a File Selection Listview dialog (for the
     kernel database) appearing on creation of new profiles,
     to avoid a time-consuming step of opening Icomp, Dcomp,
     .... modules for linking necessary database files.
     Cross-referencing between different user-created
     system profile directories must be avoided.

19/06/2001
    Implement linking of a database file into existing
     profile (the file must exist inside of the profile
     directory).


18/06/2001
 changin module screen form dialogs in Profile Mode: add icons for "Browse"
  mode:  "Next record" (arrow up), "Previous record" (arrow down),
  and "Set filter" for browsing through a subset of records.
  Add new buttons and commands: "Delete"; "Remake", "Plot" and "Print"


18/06/2001
 GTdemo: Fix a crash after calculation (or related to reading
  next record and opening the GraphDialog)
  Fixin?


15/06/2001
   Done:
   Implement "Copy" command in "Record list" with
         a possibility of editing record keys before inserting
         records (ask where to insert at the beginning)
  Module screen form dialogs: in menu "Record List", change
  "Browse" to "Copy". This menu item should work similar to
  "Move", but (i) let the user modify record key, then select
  the file where to put it for each copied record; (ii) do
  not delete the original record.


15/06/2001
    FileSelection dialog: implemented "Ok to all" button for
         multiple insertions
    ("Move", "Import" and "copy" commands in  "Record List"):
  ( In SelectDialog, added a "Ok to All" button and implemented it
  for "Record List" "Move", "Import" or new "Copy" modes, so that all
  the selected records would go into the same file.

15/06/2001
 SelectDialog "Cancel" button does not work in some
            cases (i.e., in "Record" "Save As" mode of module
            dialogs when selecting a file where to put the record),
            this makes a lot of trouble.
  Done. Needs testing

15/06/2001
  Change SelectDialog. Add mode with button "Ok to All".



14/06/2001

- changin module screen form dialogs: add icons for "Browse" mode:
  "Next record" (arrow up), "Previous record" (arrow down),
  and "Set filter" for browsing through a subset of records.
  Remove BrowseDialog and attach its functionality to the
  module screen form dialogs.

         TOArray<TDataBase *> to TIArray<TDataBase>
         TOArray<TSubModule *> to TIArray<TSubModule>
         TOArray<QLineEdit *> to TIArray<QLineEdit>
         TOArray<PlotTypeBtn *> to TIArray<PlotTypeBtn>
         TOArray<TPlot *> to TIArray<TPlot>

   - add z_sp_config mode for Profile (make short record lists for
Phases
     and DComp/ReactDC in System )




19/11/99

   -( v_dbm.h, v_dbm2.cpp ) add function DilFile() to delete file from
      data base file list
   -( visor.h, visor.cpp )  add function deleteDBDir() to delete
     directory of GEMS/Profiles/name with deleting file names in data
base
     files lists
   -(m_prfget.cpp) if error new profile building, we delete all new
Profile
    directori

============================================================================

18/11/99
  -(m_prfget.cpp, LoadMessages) more diagnostic about different stages
       of Profile opening/updating
         (it is prototype, write you remark)

  -(v_module.h) current record key is appear, if "Create" command
        in profile mode

============================================================================

17/11/99 (BudLog.dima 05/11/99)
   -(viz_cn.ini) show SDref/SDval fields on System/Compos window
     (to remove at all we must change all records SysEq, created
before)
   -(KeyDialog.cpp) lost for 04/11
   -(ms_muload.cpp/find_icnum) set MAXICNAME(=6) to compare (MAXKEYWD=7
=> error)
        bi_[\I{Fe}] translate error

          (BudLog.dima 10/03/99 )
  - vector delCm is reallocated, if set flag PcdC to '+'
  - (m_compos.cpp) no ask DCOMP/REACTDC selections, use only flag
PcDC(1)
  - (SelectDialog.cpp) in multi selection mode no select always first
line
  - DComp: SDref line, can be entered 33 symbols in my test;
           on remake mode no errors, may be your use break data to 34
size


===========================================================================
02/11/99
  -(m_prfget.cpp) changes to dcomp lists in profile, if add phase+dcomp
  -(v_module.cpp) "Save as" current db key
  -(m_phase.cpp)  owerate mehanizm to default Aq and gas phases

04/11/99
   -(m_prosess.cpp, m_gtdemo.cpp ) error put "'" to "name" field if
"Remake"
   -(v_module.h) setFilter(const char *filt)
   -(KeyDialog.cpp) save last filter in Module if OK
   -(KeyDialog.cpp) change error in selecting start key in list
   -(v_module.cpp) use last Filter in "Show" command
   -(v_module.cpp) RecOfTXT and RecToTXT messages with current key...
   -(ms_sysbc.cpp) load second copy syseq and go back to inital (must
work)
       may be error in PHbcalc() p.584: sy.Phm[k] use before
initialization

11/11/99 (BudLog.dima 03/11/99)

   -(ms_sysbc.cpp) put packed SysEq key to msg "Some b[i]<DB ..."


   -Colordialog, OnlyColorDialog work on my computer (remake all)  (NO
ERROR!)

   -(m_prfget.cpp ) appear current record key if "New" SysEq

   -(ProgressDialog.cpp) save system and close progress window, if
"Accept"
                         if "Discard" only close
                         fStopCalc not used

   - for object GD_rkl(o_gdrkey) in GTDEMO record type are setted as
            samplad PDB record key len (diferent for different Modules
)
         ( 64 default len, 58 SysEq key len)                     (NO ERROR!)


   - (m_rtparm.cpp) Override mode not work in RTParm

   - use last filter (see changes of 04/11/99, if not work write me)

   - (viz_cn.ini) show base PROCESS key in GTDEMO window

   - (m_gtdemo.cpp) use base PROCESS/PROBE key in GTDEMO remake,



12/11/99

  - (v_dbm.h, v_dbm2.cpp, v_module.cpp ) "File|Actualize"
      get old selection befor comand


16/11/99
  - ( m_reacdc.cpp, ms_sysbc.cpp ) return to inial record(key+link),
     if error  in calculation/unpacking

  - ( v_module.cpp, m_prfget.cpp, m_dcomp.cpp ....) save old
     db->UnpackKey. Before it may be lost as pointer (see REACDC error)


  - (ms_system.h, ms_system.cpp, m_prfget.cpp) insert SyTestSizes()
     instead of SyTest() on Profile update.
     Recalc only sizes of system vectors. Bulk composition mast bee
     recalculated togethe with equlibrium state to all records.
