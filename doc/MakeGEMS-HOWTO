*How to execute make operations for GEMS*


The make script is located in /home/sveta/test/gems directory.

From this directory, different modes can be invoked by 
typing  make <target>

The parameter <target> may be one of the following:

  all      create executable file

  clean    remove *.bac, *.o, *.exe ....  files

  dep      refresh dependancies of *.cpp from *.h . One have to do this 
           after changing #include directives

  rpm      create rpm file
	To prepare:
	   copy data dirs (GEMS and GEMS.sys) into /usr/src/redhat/i386/BUILD
	   copy gems source files into /usr/src/redhat/i386/BUILD
	Type 
	   'make rpm' (it will compile *optimized* version of gems 
	               and create rpm)
	   'rpm -U gems-0.99-4.rpm'
	   'rpm -e gems'
	RPM file is in /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386 
	  
	Note: optimized version of GEMS hasn't been tested thoroghly yet

  backup   creates a gems-YYYYmmdd.tar.bz2 of current directory

  backupd  creates a gems_data-YYYYmmdd.tar.bz2 of test database

  backup_win32	creates gems_code-YYYYmmdd.tar.bz2 containing only source code
	(usually used for transferring files to Win32 environment) 

  install	not implemented yet, and probably will never be :-(
  

'make RELEASE=YES' will make optimized release version of
                  GEMS without debugging and *.ini read feature;
		  don't forget to run make clean before doing it
		  
'make PROFILE=YES' will make GEMS with profile information 
		  don't forget to run make clean before doing it

    Note: I would only profile with optimized (at least -O) code,
	otherwise inline functions not inlined and you get not final picture
