HOW TO PRODUCE UPGRADED INSTALLATION PACKAGE OF GEMS_PSI FOR MAC

Needs Tres Thoenen's G4 Mac running 

1. Open a SSH terminal: 

  ssh guest@129.129.204.98:0   (password: a )

Check QTDIR (if Qt is istalled):

  echo $QTDIR

  cd work/gems2


2. Make update of GEMS source code tree use SVN client,
   for example SmartSvn 


3. Build the release executable file: 

  cp Makefile.mac Makefile
  make RELEASE=YES

This will create a release version of GEMS-PSI 
in ~/work/gems2/gems2.app/Contents/MacOS

4. Check that actual distribution directories stored 
in ~/work/gems2/shared/ are copied into
~/work/gems2/gems2.app/Contents/Resources.
It should look like this:
  ./gems2.app/
              Contents/
	               Resources/
		                 DB.default/
		                 img/
		                 doc/
		                 data/
                         projects/
                ...

If necessary, use "cp -R" command to copy the five
directories listed above from ./shared/.


Execute 

  make -f Makefile.lin copy_data

This will refresh configuration files.
It makes sense to re-read configuration files before 
producing the zip package. This needs a graphic desktop, 
either native or virtual.

5. To run GEMS in terminal: 

  cd ~/work/gems2/gems2.app 
  exec ~/work/gems2/gems2.app -d 

 or 
 
 use eclipse "Run" command with argument -d
 
 and then exit GEMS.

6. In terminal, get in ~/work/gems2/ and execute 

   make -f Makefile.lin zip

This will create the archive 'gems2-mac-{current_date}.zip' 
on the current MacOS user's Desktop (if there is an existing 
zip file, it will be renamed to 
   ~/Desktop/gems2-mac-{current_date}.zip.bak).

gems2-mac-{current_date}.zip file can be distributed by 
copying it from the desktop to your (remote) location, 
e.g. for Linux as follows:

  scp guest@129.129.204.98:/Users/guest/Desktop/gems2-mac*.zip .  

and type the "guest" user's password on the prompt.
