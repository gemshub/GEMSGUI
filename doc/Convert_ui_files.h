Porting .ui files to Qt4

1. uic3 SettingsDialogData.ui > SettingsDialogData.h
2. uic3 -impl SettingsDialogData.h SettingsDialogData.ui > SettingsDialogData.cpp

do it for compare (use end of SettingsDialogData.h and
SettingsDialogData.cpp in SettingsDialog.cpp )

3. uic3 -convert SettingsDialogData.ui > SettingsDialog4.ui

Converts a Qt Designer 3 .ui file to the QtDesigner 4 format.

4. Open SettingsDialog4.ui file and change
  - Q3ButtonGroup to ( QGroupBox + QButtonGroup in *.cpp if necessary )
  - Q3GroupBox   to QGroupBox
  - add ful Layout for all window
  - add icons for img.qrc file
  - "Form Settings" uncheck "Pixmap Function"
  - Q3ListView to QTreeWidget or QListWidget
  - Q3ListViewItem to QTreeWidgetItem
  - Q3ListBox to QListWidget
  - Q3Frame to QFrame
  - Q3ProgressBar to QProgressBar
  - setCaption to setWindowTitle   
  - .toLatin1().data()

5. uic SettingsDialog4.ui > SettingsDialog4.h

Builds source file for Qt4 version


6.qt3to4 SettingsDialog.h, SettingsDialog4.cpp

7. Edit resulting files (see 1. 2. )

8. For QWizard:
	do as ProcessWizard



Done!!!!!!

for the selected project", the hierarchy of database files in the dialog is screwed up.

Fixed bug - I changed the status of gas phase to "-" but when pressing BCC button it would go

Fixed bugs
1. It appears that it is not possible to enter the indicator for unknown value "---"
   into any cells that should be recalculated manually. But better use command "Clear".

   on Single Thermodynamic Window. (Problem in diferent threads for calculation and showing )

1. If error in condition, we ignore this condition, after question
2. If error when calculate condition, we set result to false (do not print this line), after question
3. Print "NULL" value, if array is not allocated

Problems in scripts:
1.   "pscript-sorption:0004:system:"
     Table 3A - OK, but error data in SCMT_, header must be changed (change columns count)
2.   "pscript-seqreac:0001:system:"
     Table 3 - xp_ array is not allocated in test Projects
3.   "pscript-eqst-aqsorp:0002:multi:"
     Table 2,  error in condition for sati => script must be changed

14/12/2009
Inserted changes into "The read from GEMIPM2K files menu item"
I. Before executing this commant you must read and recalculate start record
   (from produce a set of DCH, IPM and DBR files )
II. Executing command
1.Clone the current SysEq? record (change the record key);
2.Clear the xd_, xa_, xp_ arrays to zeros and copy pmp->B (B_) vector to syp->BI (BI_ vector);
3.Offer the user to select the *.lst file name containing a set of DCH, IPM and DBR files to read in;
4.Read the contents of files into the MULTI (GEM IPM work structure);
5.Test changes in the modified system relative to MULTI (only for information);
6.Get internal mass of the system to scale down/up (to reproduce a GEMIPM2K calculation);
7.Unpack the DBR file content into the MULTI data structure (SD)
8.Unpack the pmp->B vector (b) into syp->BI (BI_ vector).

III. We can get different results into GEMS and into GEMIPM2K
  as different values into G, V ...
   (interpolation of thermodynamic data or precision )

Changed Remake command for System

12/02/2010

T. Wagner
1. Module windows - remove outer frame about data objects.
    We use outer frame around work&scroll area; menus and buttons are command area,
2. We have anreadable headings - We must change column size for object in viz_cn.ini file
   full name we can see into tooltip and on statusbar line
3. We can move between different tables using "Tab" key, We can move between cells in one table
   using arrow keys
4. Unreadable characters in Const records (We do not use this records in GEMS3 )


To do
    1.
      In some profiles we have not the gem2mt files and so don not reload it.
      If load "Kaolinite" after "CalDolCol" all gem2mt records can be loaded.
    2.
     there is a problem with correct recalculation of records in cases where phases are
     switched off. When a phase has been switched off and the SysEq? record was
     recalculated directly (even when the BCC has been recalculated before IPM minimization),
     the result is not correct. Only when the record is reloaded after a phase has been switched off
     and then recalculated, the correct result is obtained. This likely is related to the execution
     of GammaCalc?() in LINK_TP_MODE that is usually done when a record is reloaded
