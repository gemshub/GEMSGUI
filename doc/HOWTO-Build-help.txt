
Gems Help Collection Files


If it is just about some corrected help files, there should
be no problem to refresh them in GEMS3. 


Instructions to add new files or remove some obsolete ones 

1. Edit file "gems3.qhp"

   To add a file    -  add line "<file>name.exp<\file>" into section <files>
   To remove a file -  remove  correspondent line into section <files>
   
   To change "Index" list you must edit section  <keywords>
     ( add/remove line <keyword name="keywordtext" ref="link"/> )
   
   To change  "Contents" list you must edit section  <toc>
     ( add/remove line <section title="Title text" ref="link"> </section> to necessary hierarchy level )

2. To change  <title>,<applicationIcon> and <aboutDialog> edit file "gems3.qhcp" 


3. To create the binary collection file, run the qcollectiongenerator tool
   (see setup_help for linux):

   qcollectiongenerator gems3.qhcp -o gemshelp.qhc


4. To test the generated collection file, start Qt Assistant in the following way
   (see run_assistant for linux):

   assistant -collectionFile gemshelp.qhc
