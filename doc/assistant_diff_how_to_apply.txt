To do this, you can use a MinGW patch version, or apply the patch using linux. Change to the directory:

qt/tools/assistant/lib
To copy to clipboard, switch view to plain text mode 
There you can find the file that needs to be patched: qhelpgenerator.cpp
Now apply the patch, using:

patch -p1 qhelpgenerator.cpp -i assistant.diff
 
go to the assistant dir and run the mingw32-make command. You will get new versions for assistant.exe, qcollectiongenerator.exe, qhelper.exe and a few more.

Since I don't have sources for qt 4.7.1 on linux, and since qch help files generated in Windows also work on linux. I'll wait for a patched linux version.

Hope this can help. Remember that this worked for a MinGW qt 4.7.0 install.
