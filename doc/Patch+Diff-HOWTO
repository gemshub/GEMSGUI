to make diff from one version to another:

1) change to gems parent directory
2) assume new gems dir is 'new_dir' and old is 'old_dir'
3) diff -rcbN --exclude-from=diff.exclude old_dir new_dir > gems-1999mmdd-a.diff

options:
    -r recursive into directories
    -c context diff - if some chnages were made to file being patched,
         patch will try to find line being changed anyway!!!
    -b skip changes in white space
    -N if file in exist in one dir and dosen't in other
	treat it like it was empty in other
    --exclude-from=diff.exclude 
	do not compare files listed in diff.exclude

  gems-1999mmdd-a.diff - made 1999/mm/dd by Andy 
	
4) optionally bzip2 or gzip gems-1999xxxx-a.diff

	
To apply patch:

1) change to gems dir
2) move patch file here
3) gzip or 'bzip2 -cd gems-1999xxxx-a.diff.bz2 | patch -p1'

options:
    -p1 skips one level of directory (because we diff'ed in gems parent and 
	applying in gems directory)
	
	
should work now :)

I use next diff.exclude:

out
*.bak
*.o
*.html
*.out
*.xpm
*.bmp
*~
*.moc.cpp
*.orig
*.rej
Makefile
Makefile.common
gems
