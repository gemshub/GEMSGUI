REQUIREMENTS for GEMS v0.91:

UNIX:
    
1)	egcs-1.0.3 or later (if you going to compile it)

2)	glibc-2.0.7 for Linux or higher (actually, any libc.* for other Unixes)
2)	qt-2.0 or later (can work with Qt-1.4x but this support will be removed
	 soon!!)
3)	libstdc++-2.8.0 (if compiled with egcs-1.0.3)
        libstdc++-2.9.0 (if compiled with egcs-1.1 or later)
	
4)	andy HTML-browser for reading docs if compiled against Qt-1.4x 
	(will be obsolete soon!!)
        

WIN32:

1)	MSVC 5.0/6.0 (still does not work)
2)	Borland C++ Builder 3.0 or higher (tested mostly with BCB 4 
	+ patch 1 and 2)
3)	one should use new makefiles (they are different for MSVC and BCB and 
	GNU make)
4)	convert *.ini,*.txt (and recommended *.cpp, *.h) files with 
	'unix2dos' command. THIS IS IMPORTANT! Otherwise GEMS can crash.


COMPILING:

1)	for Qt-1.4x
    Makefile.common should include -DQTv1 in CCFLAGS
    and 3 paths - to libqt, includes/qt and moc
    
2)	for Qt-2.x
    Makefile.common should include -DQTv2 in CCLAGS
    and 3 paths - to libqt, includes/qt and moc
    
RUNNING:

1)	flag '-f' - some Sveta's stuff :-)
2)	flag '-d' - reload visor arrays info from
	'./data/*.ini' and save it in '<sysDir>/visor.data/*.dat' files
	 (only if compiled not in RELEASE mode) 
3)	flag '-c' - load default DB configuration - default DB files
4)	flag '-s <sysDir>' set GEMS system dir to <sysDir>
5)	flag '-u <userDir>' set GEMS user dir to <userDir>


NOTE:	QT-2.0.x has some glitches, we would recommend Qt-2.1 (or 2.2)
	 when its available
