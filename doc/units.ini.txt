* Units description file (units.ini) *


Used for setting range of values for so called CHECKBOXes,
(sorry this definition just got stuck with us) in reality they are DropDownLists

Format of the line

Name	<set1>[/<set2>]...

Name:
    name of the union
    
<set>:
    set of the chars allowed
    
If there's several sets separated by '/' then for every new column(?) 
    used next <set>, last <set> is propagated for the rest of the columns
