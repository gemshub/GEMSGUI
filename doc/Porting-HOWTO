* This file contains some porting issues. *


Attention:	there is a bug in GCC 2.95.x with causes compiler error on *DialogData.cpp
     files wich contain 'QColor( QRgb(0) )' expressions.
Workaround:	change  'QColor( QRgb(0) )' to  'QColor( (unsigned)QRgb(0) )' 
Note:		problem seems to be gone with QTARCH 2.0 and/or gcc-2.96!!

     
Attention: 	there is a bug in C++ Builder 4 wich causes compiler error on *DialogData.cpp
Temporary Workaround: change NULL parameter to (const char*) NULL 
Workaround: 	should be gone with QTARCH 2.0 (may be with patch 1 or 2?)


Attention: 	there is a bug MSVC 5/6 wich causes internal compiler errors
Temporary Workaround:  play with order of includes of QT headers ;-\


Linux:	works great !!! yahoo!!! :-)


FreeBSD:
    EGCS-1.1.2, GCC-2.95.x, works with BSD Make but GNU Make is preferrable
    we have to simulate 'gcvt()' with 'sprintf()' in v_user.h, gcvt() is missing
    from BSD libc :(
    
Solaris:
    EGCS-1.1.2 or GCC-2.95.x, XPG4 Make or GNU Make
    X windows headers are buggy for GNU C++
    Makefile.common: add '-isystem /usr/openwin/include' to CCFLAGS
    
Windows:
    use Borland C++ Builder 4 or MSVC 5/6, but BCB 4 is much better
    anyway both 'make's are different so use special Makefiles 
    for either Win32 system
    Also you have to apply Patch 1 and 2 to BCB 4 to escape from some troubles
    
AIX:
