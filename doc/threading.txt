in case of usigng threads (QThread) in GEMS:
- add option -DQT_THREAD_SUPPORT=1 to the compiler
- do not use other GUI functions from calculation thread than vf...
    i.e. from all functions called from CalcEqstat and CalcEqstst itself
- most vf... functions have "qApp->lock()/unlock()" blocks to prevent crashes
- this might not help on some platforms :(
- to add step point in calculation put "STEP_POINT();" line (it's a macro from stepwise.h)
- to switch between threads in gdb use "thread #", where # is the number of the thread

good luck
